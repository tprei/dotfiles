# Directory Variables

`dirvars` gives each new shell the variables of the `.tern-env` files
between its directory and the home directory, after explicit approval of
each file's exact contents. Like `direnv`, it does not trust arbitrary
checkout-controlled environment files automatically. It is the example for the host's `spawn`
filter: a synchronous hook on the daemon's spawn path, with a hard time
limit and an environment that holds less than you might expect.

## What it demonstrates

| Surface | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `tern.on("spawn", fn(spec) -> spec?)` | Adding variables to a shell before it starts |
| `tern.on("cwd")`, `EffectCx:toast` | Telling a running shell that the files where it is now differ |
| `tern.on("pane_exited")` | Forgetting a pane's baseline |
| `tern.fs.exists`, `tern.fs.read(path, max_bytes)` | Walking up the tree and safely bounding regular-file reads |
| `tern.block.define`, `tern.kv` | Reviewing and approving exact file contents on the host |
| `tern.getenv` | The daemon's own environment, as a fallback for `${NAME}` |
| `tern.log.warn` | Reporting malformed lines without interrupting anyone |
| `require("./envfile")` | A parser module kept apart from the hook code |

The plugin is host-only: the manifest names no window entry.

## Install

From where you unpacked [the SDK](../index.md#the-sdk):

```sh
tern plugin install tern-sdk/examples/dirvars
```

While you change it, link it instead so Tern reloads it on every save:

```sh
tern plugin link tern-sdk/examples/dirvars
```

Copy `sample.tern-env` to a project as `.tern-env`. Open **Directory
Variables** from the block palette in that project, review the complete
escaped contents, and click **Approve these exact bytes** for each file.
Only then open a new shell pane and run `echo $TERN_DIRVARS`. The optional
block argument selects an absolute project directory.

### Approval is content-specific

Every spawn re-reads each file with the native 64 KiB bound, then compares
its bytes to that path's approved bytes in the plugin's existing KV.
Unknown, changed, unreadable and nonregular content is denied by default.
A change to even a comment invalidates approval; observing a change removes
the stored approval. The block displays every byte (non-ASCII/control bytes
are escaped), with no truncated preview. Clicking approval re-reads the
file and rejects changes since display; it cannot approve unseen contents.
**Refresh files** reviews edits and **Revoke approval** denies future imports.
Approval stores at most 64 KiB per path, on the daemon's machine; the
manifest-listed host block also appears in the palette on remote hosts.

Review the entire file, not just familiar variable names: variables such
as `ZDOTDIR` can make a shell execute checkout-controlled startup code.
Trust in this installed plugin does not imply trust in every project.
No variable denylist is a substitute for this explicit approval step.

## The file format

```sh
# A sample .tern-env: copy it to a project as `.tern-env`.
# Review and explicitly approve its bytes in the Directory Variables block.
# One KEY=VALUE per line; lines starting with # are comments.

# Bare values end at a ` #` comment and expand ${NAME}.
APP_ENV=development   # read by the app's config loader
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/${APP_ENV}

# Double quotes keep spaces and # and understand \n \t \" \\ \$.
GREETING="hello # not a comment"
PRICE="costs \${5}"

# Single quotes are literal: nothing expands.
PATTERN='${not expanded}'

# `export` is accepted, so the file also works with `source`.
export RUST_LOG=info

# A name no file set falls back to the daemon's own environment (${HOME});
# an undefined name expands to nothing.
TOOLS=${HOME}/src/app/bin

# PATH is accepted, but ${PATH} is the daemon's, and a login shell's
# profile runs after the filter and rebuilds PATH (on macOS, path_helper
# puts the system's entries first). Prefer project variables like TOOLS
# and prepend them in your shell's rc file when the order matters.
PATH=${TOOLS}:${PATH}
```

| Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `KEY=VALUE` | `KEY` matches `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`; blanks around `=` are allowed |
| `# …` | A comment line; in a bare value, ` #` (a blank, then `#`) starts a comment |
| `export KEY=VALUE` | Same as without `export`, so the file also works with `source` |
| Bare value | Ends at a ` #` comment; expands `${NAME}` |
| `"double"` | Keeps spaces and `#`; understands `\n \t \" \\ \$`; expands `${NAME}` |
| `'single'` | Literal: no escapes, no expansion |

`$NAME` without braces is left as written: only `${NAME}` expands. A line
that doesn't parse is skipped and logged with its file and line number.

## Design

### What the filter sees

The daemon runs every plugin's `spawn` filter, in plugin id order, on each
shell pane it is about to start. The `SpawnSpec` holds `program`, `args`,
`cwd` (always set) and `env`, and `env` is only what the
daemon itself sets on top of the pane's base environment:

| In `spec.env` | Not in `spec.env` |
| --- | --- |
| `TERN_PANE`, `TERN_IDENTITY`, `TERN_PANE_SOCKET`, `TERN_WINDOW_KEY`, `TERN_WINDOW_SOCKET`, `TERN_LENSES`, `TERN_COMPLETE` | `HOME`, `PATH`, `USER`, `SHELL`, anything from your profile |

A local pane starts from a fresh login's environment (your account's
`HOME`, `USER`, `SHELL` and a `PATH` the login shell builds), not from the
daemon's, and the
daemon applies `spec.env` over it. So `dirvars` can add and override
variables but cannot read the pane's base environment. When `${NAME}`
names something no file set and `spec.env` doesn't hold, it falls back to
`tern.getenv(NAME)`: the daemon process's environment. `${HOME}` is the
same either way; `${PATH}` is the daemon's `PATH`, which may differ from the
shell's.

The filter adds the variables directly to `spec.env` and returns `spec`;
returning `nil` (no file applies) leaves the spec untouched. Keys starting
with `TERN_` are skipped with a warning, since the daemon's own variables
are how the pane talks back to Tern.

### Nearer files win

`chain(cwd)` walks from the pane's directory up to `$HOME` (`USERPROFILE`
on Windows), or to the filesystem root for a directory outside home, and
collects each `.tern-env` that exists, farthest first. Only approved content
applies. `apply` then sets those files' keys in that order, so a key in
`~/src/webapp/api/.tern-env` replaces the same key from
`~/src/webapp/.tern-env`. Expansion happens while applying, so a nearer
file sees what the farther ones set:

```sh
# ~/src/webapp/.tern-env
APP_ENV=development

# ~/src/webapp/api/.tern-env
APP_ENV=test
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/app_${APP_ENV}   # app_test
```

`TERN_DIRVARS` lists the files that applied, farthest first, joined with
`:`, so a shell prompt or script can show where its variables came from.

### Staying under 50 ms

The daemon waits at most 50 ms for each plugin's filter, measured from the
moment it hands the spec over. A filter that runs longer is skipped for
that spawn (the log says `plugin spawn filter took over 50 ms; skipped`),
and the shell starts without its variables. The wait includes any queue:
a host worker handles one message at a time, so a slow hook or block
render in the same plugin delays the filter. The approval block reads and
renders only bounded files; it shares that queue with the filter.

The work per spawn is one `exists` per ancestor directory (typically four
to eight) and one `read` per file found. `tern.fs` has no `stat`, so the
plugin cannot ask whether a file changed since the last spawn. It caches by
content instead:

| Cache key | Cost per spawn | Staleness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path only | No reads | An edited file applies only after a plugin reload |
| Path plus a time-to-live | No reads within the TTL | Edits wait out the TTL |
| Path plus content (this plugin) | Reads every file, parses only changed ones | None |

Reading a few small files is microseconds when the operating system has
them cached; parsing is the part worth skipping, and comparing the text
with the cached copy skips it. Files over 64 KiB are refused, which bounds
both the buffered read and the parse. The bound is enforced in native IO
before allocating/reading oversized contents, not after creating a Lua
string. Only regular, non-symlink files are accepted: FIFOs, devices,
directories and raced-in nonregular targets are rejected on Unix and
Windows. A one-byte probe detects growth beyond the bound. Slow regular
files (for example on a network filesystem) can still exceed the filter's
time limit; the bound is not a deadline.

### Running shells

A process's environment is fixed when it starts: no plugin can change the
variables of a shell that is already running. `dirvars` says so instead.
At spawn it remembers, by `TERN_PANE`, which files applied and their
contents. On every `cwd` event it computes the files that apply in the new
directory and keeps those the shell didn't start with or that changed
since. If any remain, it toasts once for that pane, directory and set of
files:

> ~/src/webapp/.tern-env applies here
> This shell didn't load it; new panes pick it up.

Leaving a project is not reported: the toast is about variables you are
missing, not ones you still have. `pane_exited` drops the pane's records.

## Limits

- **New shells only.** Shells that started before the plugin loaded (or
  before a plugin reload) have no recorded baseline, so they get neither
  the variables nor the toast.
- **Startup files run after the filter.** The shell's profile and rc files
  can override any variable, and a login shell rebuilds `PATH` (on macOS,
  `path_helper` puts the system's entries first). Prepend to `PATH` in the
  rc file when order matters.
- **The daemon's machine.** Files are read where the daemon runs; a
  remote host needs the plugin installed there.
- **Shells only.** Plugin blocks don't pass through the `spawn` filter.
- **No unset.** A file can set a variable to the empty string but not
  remove it.
