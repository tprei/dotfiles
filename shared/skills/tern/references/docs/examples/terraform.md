# Terraform Plans

`terraform` turns the human-readable output of `terraform plan` and
`tofu plan` into a native view: summary badges, diagnostics with their
source excerpt, and the planned resources grouped by action, the
destructive groups first. Clicking a resource copies its address. It is the
example for a command lens with its own stylesheet.

## What it demonstrates

| Surface | Half | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[[lenses]]` `match` globs | Manifest | Claiming `terraform plan`, `tofu plan` and their `-chdir=` forms |
| `tern.lens.define` with `open`, `line`, `finish`, `view` | Host | Parsing the plan line by line and drawing it |
| `ui.badge`, `ui.section`, `ui.diagnostic`, `ui.overflow` | Host | Summary, groups, errors and warnings, long groups |
| `actions = { click = … }` on a node, lens `event` | Host | Copying a resource address on click |
| `EffectCx:copy`, `EffectCx:toast` | Host | The clipboard and the confirmation |
| `role` props and `styles` in the manifest | Both | Coloring rows by action, marking destructive plans |

The plugin has no window half: lens views and their CSS are all it needs.
The stylesheet is still loaded by each window, because CSS is a window
concern.

## Install

From where you unpacked [the SDK](../index.md#the-sdk):

```sh
tern plugin install tern-sdk/examples/terraform
```

While you change it, link it instead so Tern reloads it on every save:

```sh
tern plugin link tern-sdk/examples/terraform
```

Lenses need shell integration (it reports each command line) and the
`command_lenses` setting, both on by default. Run `terraform plan` in a
project; the block's **Raw** toggle still shows the original output.

## Design

### What it claims, and what it leaves alone

A lens claim is declarative. Every replica of a pane (the daemon, each
window, iOS, the web client) has to agree on which commands become lens
blocks, but only the host runs Lua, so the decision is made from the
manifest's `match` globs against the program and its arguments joined by
single spaces. `open` cannot decline a command the globs matched; narrowing
the globs is the only way to say no (see [Command Lenses](../guides/lenses.md)).

| Pattern | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `terraform plan`, `terraform plan *` | A plain plan, with or without options |
| `terraform -chdir=* plan`, `terraform -chdir=* plan *` | A plan of another directory |
| `tofu …` | The same four for OpenTofu |

`terraform apply` is deliberately not claimed. Without `-auto-approve` it
prints the plan and then waits at `Enter a value:` for you to type `yes`.
Reading a line switches on none of the terminal modes that make Tern abort a
lens and replay the raw output (an alternate screen, mouse or keyboard
modes), so the native view would keep covering the question it is asking.
A plan asks only for a required variable that has no value; `-input=false`
makes it fail instead, which the lens shows as a diagnostic.

Some plans are not meant for people: `terraform plan -json` streams JSON
and `terraform plan -help` prints usage. Neither contains anything the
parser recognizes, so `view` returns `nil`, and a `nil` view leaves the
block showing the raw output.

### Reading the plan line by line

`line` is called once per output line while the command runs, and the
view is redrawn at most every 250 ms, so the parser is a small state
machine that never looks back more than one line:

| Output | What the lens records |
| --- | --- |
| `<addr>: Refreshing state...` | A count shown as "N refreshed" |
| `Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform` | Enters the drift section |
| `Terraform will perform the following actions:` | Enters the actions section |
| `  # <addr> will be created` (and the other suffixes) | A resource with its action |
| `  # (because …)`, `  # (moved from …)` | A note on the resource above |
| `Changes to Outputs:` and `  + name` rows | Output changes |
| `Plan: N to add, M to change, K to destroy.` | The summary |
| `No changes.` | The no-changes state |
| `╷`, `│ Error: …`, `│ …`, `╵` | A diagnostic and its body |

Resource headers are matched against a table of suffixes ("will be
created", "will be updated in-place", "must be replaced", "is tainted, so
must be replaced", "will be read during apply", …). The table is ordered so
that a longer suffix is tried before a shorter one it ends with, and a
`(deposed object …)` qualifier is split off into the row's note. Headers in
the drift section use a separate table ("has changed", "has been deleted"),
because those resources are not part of what the plan will do.

Diagnostics are the boxes Terraform draws with `╷`, `│` and `╵`. The first
`│ Error: title` or `│ Warning: title` line opens one; `on main.tf line 12`
gives its location, the numbered lines under it become the snippet, and the
paragraphs after that become notes. Terraform prints the paths relative to
the directory it ran in, so `open` keeps the shell's `cwd` (or the
`-chdir=` directory) and `ui.diagnostic` resolves the path against it,
which makes the location a link to the file.

`finish` records the exit status. With `-detailed-exitcode` a plan exits 2
when it has changes, so only statuses other than 0 and 2 count as a failed
plan.

### The view

The top row is the summary as badges, each with the tone of what it means:

| Badge | Tone |
| --- | --- |
| "N to import" | `info` |
| "N to add" | `success` |
| "N to change" | `warning` |
| "N to destroy" | `error` |
| "No changes" | `success` |
| "Planning" plus running counts per action, while the command runs | `pending`, `muted` |
| "Plan failed", "N errors" | `error` |
| "N warnings" | `warning` |

Below it come the diagnostics, then one collapsible `ui.section` per
action. The order is the order a reviewer reads in: Destroy, Replace,
Update in place, Create, then the quieter Import, Move, Forget and Read.
Each section has a `key` naming its action, so its identity does not shift
when another group appears above it while the plan streams in.
Read-during-apply data sources and the drift section ("Changed outside
Terraform") start collapsed: they explain the plan but are not changes it
makes. A group longer than 200 rows ends with `ui.overflow`, the "… N more"
line that points at Raw.

### Copying an address

Each resource row is a text node whose props carry a click action:

```lua
local p: { [string]: any } = node.p or {}
p.actions = { click = "copy-address=" .. r.addr }
node.p = p
```

A click arrives in the lens's `event` handler as
`{ev = "action", act = "copy-address", value = "<addr>"}`. Only the first
`=` separates the action name from its value, so addresses such as
`terraform_data.item["a=b"]` arrive intact in `ev.value`. The handler uses
that value without splitting or decoding it:

```lua
if ev.ev == "action" and ev.act == "copy-address" and type(ev.value) == "string" then
	cx:copy(ev.value)
	cx:toast("success", "Copied resource address", ev.value)
end
```

The event's `EffectCx` delivers the copy and toast to the
windows showing the pane. Lens state lives on the host worker for the last
256 captures per plugin; clicking an older block replays `open`, `line` and
`finish` over its saved output first, so the click works after a daemon
restart too.

### Styling through roles

The plugin never styles by position or by Tern's internal class names
alone. Every rule is scoped to the lens block's role,
`.sf-block[data-role='lens.plugin.terraform.plan']`, and the plugin sets
its own roles on the nodes it wants to target:

| Role | Node | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terraform.plan` | The view's root | None |
| `terraform.plan.danger` | The root, when anything is destroyed or replaced | A red rule down the left edge |
| `terraform.<action>` | Each resource row | `--tc` set to the action's tone, used by the hover highlight |

Colors come from Tern's tone variables (`--sf-ok`, `--sf-warn`, `--sf-bad`,
`--sf-info`, `--sf-muted`), so light and dark themes both follow. The file
is listed under `styles` in the manifest and installed as the global sheet
`plugin:local:terraform:styles`; see [Chrome and Styling](../guides/chrome.md).

## Limits

- The parser reads Terraform's human output, which is not a stable
  interface; a future release that rewords a header leaves that resource
  out (the summary line still counts it).
- Resources are grouped by action only, not by module.
- A plan that stops at a `var.name Enter a value:` prompt hides the prompt
  until you switch to Raw; run plans with `-input=false` or a `.tfvars` file.
- Plans of more than 200 resources in one action show the first 200 and a
  pointer to Raw.
