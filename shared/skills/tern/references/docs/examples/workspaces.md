# Project Workspaces

`workspaces` opens the tabs a project describes in `.tern/workspace.json`:
named tabs, split panes, a directory and a command for each. It is a
window-only plugin and the example for `cx.layout:tab`, built-in command
overrides and a status formatter that stays pure while reflecting state the
plugin changes.

## What it demonstrates

| Surface | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `tern.command`, `tern.bind` | "Open workspace" and "Edit workspace file" |
| `cx.session:focused()`, `cx.session:panes()` | The focused pane's directory |
| `tern.fs.exists`, `tern.fs.read`, `tern.json.decode` | Finding and reading the workspace file |
| `cx.layout:tab(spec)` | Building each tab from a split tree, and reporting panes that couldn't start |
| `tern.on("window_start")`, `tern.getenv`, `cx.session:tabs()` | Opening `TERN_WORKSPACE` at launch, adopting restored tabs |
| `tern.on("tab_closed")` | Forgetting a workspace when its last tab closes |
| `tern.override("new_tab", fn)` | New tabs at the workspace root |
| `cx.layout:new_tab`, `cx:open` | The override's tab; opening the file |
| `tern.chrome.status`, `tern.chrome.refresh` | The workspace's name in the status line, redrawn when a workspace opens or closes |
| `styles` in the manifest | Styling the plugin's own segment |

## Install

From where you unpacked [the SDK](../index.md#the-sdk):

```sh
tern plugin install tern-sdk/examples/workspaces
```

While you change it, link it instead so Tern reloads it on every save:

```sh
tern plugin link tern-sdk/examples/workspaces
```

Then open a shell inside a project that has `.tern/workspace.json` (the
plugin folder has a sample) and run **Open workspace** from the palette or
with `cmd+alt+shift+o` (`ctrl+alt+shift+o` off macOS). To open a workspace
when Tern starts, start Tern with `TERN_WORKSPACE` set to the project root
or to its `workspace.json`:

```sh
TERN_WORKSPACE=~/src/webapp tern
```

## The workspace file

```json
{
  "name": "webapp",
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "code",
      "split": "right",
      "panes": [
        { "command": "nvim ." },
        {
          "split": "down",
          "panes": [
            { "cwd": "web", "command": "npm run dev" },
            { "cwd": "api", "command": "cargo watch -x run" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "shell",
      "panes": [{}, { "block": "longrun.slow" }]
    },
    {
      "name": "infra",
      "cwd": "infra"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Top level | Shown in toasts and the status line; default: the root folder's name |
| `tabs` | Top level | Non-empty array of tabs, opened in order |
| `name` | Tab | The tab's name |
| `cwd` | Tab, group, pane | Directory, relative to the enclosing one (the root at the top); absolute and `~/` paths work |
| `split` | Tab, group | `right` (default), `down`, `left` or `up`: how `panes` divide |
| `panes` | Tab, group | Array of panes and groups; a tab without `panes` holds one shell |
| `command` | Pane | A command line the login shell runs (`$SHELL -l -c`) |
| `block` | Pane | A plugin block kind, such as `longrun.slow` |
| `args` | Pane | The block's launch arguments (strings); only with `block` |

A pane with neither `command` nor `block` is a shell. A command pane
behaves like any pane whose program ends: when the command succeeds and
exits, the pane closes.

## Design

### From a list of panes to a split tree

`cx.layout:tab` takes a `TabSpec`, a binary tree: a leaf has a `launch`,
an inner node has `split` and two children, `[1]` and `[2]`, and `cwd`
inherits downwards. People think of a tab as "these three panes side by
side", so the file uses lists and `workspace.luau` converts them. `group`
splits a list in two, recursively, with the smaller half first:

```text
panes: [a, b, c], split: right

        right
       /     \
      a      right
            /     \
           b       c
```

`a` gets half the tab and `b` and `c` share the other half, which suits
the common layout of an editor next to two tools. A group inside `panes`
(an entry with its own `panes`) divides its share its own way, as `code`
in the sample does with `split: "down"`.

Every directory is resolved to an absolute path while converting, so the
spec never depends on where the focused pane is when it is built. Tern
creates the first leaf as a new tab, then splits it once per inner node,
and names the tab when the spec has `name`.

### Errors that point at the line

Malformed files are common while someone edits them, so `workspace.load`
validates as it converts and raises messages that name the field:
`tabs[1].panes[2].cwd: must be a string`. It raises with level `0`, which
leaves out Lua's file and line prefix, and the window half catches the
error with `pcall` and shows it in a toast. Nothing is built until the
whole file has converted, so a mistake in the third tab doesn't leave two
tabs behind.

### Finding the root

"Open workspace" takes the focused pane's directory and walks up with
`tern.fs.exists` until it finds `.tern/workspace.json`, the same way `git`
finds `.git`. The window half runs on your machine, so the walk needs no
daemon round trip and costs a few `stat` calls.

### Remembering what is open

The window half keeps `opened`, a table from root to the workspace's name
and the ids of the tabs it built. Each window has its own VM, so each
window has its own table, and a plugin reload starts it empty. `tab_closed`
removes a tab id, and the workspace when its last tab is gone. Opening a
workspace that is already open toasts instead of opening its tabs twice.

### Opening at launch

`window_start` runs once per plugin per window, after the window's
sessions are restored. It reads `TERN_WORKSPACE` from the window process's
environment, accepting the root or the path of its `workspace.json`, and
refuses a relative path, since the window process's working directory says
nothing about what the user meant.

A restored session may already have the workspace's tabs from last time.
Before building, the handler looks for tabs whose name matches one in the
file and whose directory is inside the root, and adopts them into `opened`
instead of opening a second set.

### New tabs at the root

`tern.override("new_tab", fn)` runs before the built-in New Tab, wherever
it comes from: the palette, the menu or its key. When the focused pane is
inside an opened workspace (the deepest root wins when workspaces nest),
the override opens a shell at the root with `cx.layout:new_tab` and
returns `true`, so the built-in doesn't run. Anywhere else it returns
`false` and Tern opens its usual tab. See
[Commands, Keys, and Overrides](../guides/commands.md).

### A pure status segment

The status formatter returns the workspace's name for a pane inside an
opened root. It reads only the in-memory `opened` table, never the disk:
formatters run while Tern draws, under a 4 ms budget, and Tern caches each
answer per input (`{pane, cwd, program, title, busy}`) until a plugin reloads,
registers something or calls `tern.chrome.refresh()`.

`opened` is not part of that input, so a pane that already existed inside
the root would keep its cached answer, no segment, after the workspace
opens. Every change to `opened` (a build, adopting restored tabs at launch,
the last tab of a workspace closing) therefore calls
`tern.chrome.refresh()`, which drops the cached answers and redraws the
status line with the current `opened`.

Clicking the segment runs "Edit workspace file". The manifest's
`workspaces.css` makes the segment bold; Tern installs it as the sheet
`plugin:local:workspaces:styles`, and the selector
`#statusline .sl-plugin[data-plugin="workspaces"]` touches only this
plugin's segments. See [Chrome and Styling](../guides/chrome.md).

## Limits

- **Every window runs `window_start`.** A window opened later with New
  Window starts with no workspace tabs, so with `TERN_WORKSPACE` set it
  opens the workspace too.
- **Local files.** The walk and the read use the window's machine. For a
  pane on a remote host, the directory names a remote path and the
  workspace is found only if the same path exists locally.
- **Missing directories.** A `cwd` that doesn't exist starts the pane at
  the home directory.
- **Missing blocks.** `cx.layout:tab` leaves out a split whose new side
  would start with a block kind no loaded plugin defines, with everything
  under it, and builds the rest; a tab whose first pane is such a block
  isn't opened. Either way it returns an error as its second value, and
  `build` collects them into an "Opened *name* incomplete" toast.
- **Plain JSON.** No comments or trailing commas.
