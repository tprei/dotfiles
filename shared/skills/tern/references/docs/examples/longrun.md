# Long-Running Commands

`longrun` notices the commands that keep you waiting. When a command line
runs past a threshold (15 seconds by default) it toasts the outcome as it
ends, keeps the last 50 such commands, and lists them in a "Slow Commands"
block next to the commands running right now. It is the smallest example
that uses both halves for one feature, with a module they share.

## What it demonstrates

| Surface | Half | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tern.on("command_started" / "command_finished" / "pane_exited")` | Host | Timing every pane's commands, including panes no window shows |
| `EffectCx:toast` | Host | "cargo build --release finished in 1m 12s" |
| `tern.kv` | Host | The history and the threshold, as one writer |
| `tern.block.define` with `title`, `view`, `key`, `event` | Host | The Slow Commands block, its dock and its keys |
| `tern.timer`, `BlockCx:render` | Host | Live elapsed times, only while something runs |
| `tern.command`, `tern.bind` | Window | "Show slow commands" and its key |
| `cx.session:panes()`, `cx.layout:focus`, `cx:new_block` | Window | Focusing the block, or opening it |
| Window events, `cx.session:focused()`, `cx.session:panes()` | Window | Refreshing focus and command liveness from current snapshots |
| `tern.chrome.status`, `tern.chrome.refresh`, `tern.timer` | Window | A status segment with the focused pane's running time, ticking once a second |
| `require("./common")` | Both | Shared parsing and formatting |

## Install

From where you unpacked [the SDK](../index.md#the-sdk):

```sh
tern plugin install tern-sdk/examples/longrun
```

While you change it, link it instead so Tern reloads it on every save:

```sh
tern plugin link tern-sdk/examples/longrun
```

The timings come from shell integration's prompt marks, so panes need it on
(the default). Run `sleep 20` and wait for the toast, then press
`cmd+alt+shift+l` (`ctrl+alt+shift+l` off macOS) to see the block.

## Design

### Why the work is on the host

The daemon measures each command itself: when a shell reports that a
command line ended, the daemon emits `command_finished` with the exit
status and `took_ms`, the time since the matching `command_started`. Both
halves can hear these events, and `longrun` deliberately records them on
the host:

| Concern | Host half | Window half |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Panes it hears | Every pane of the daemon, including sessions no window shows | Only the panes of its own window, and only while the window is open |
| `tern.kv` writers | One VM per daemon | One VM per window, so one history entry would be written once per open window |
| Command directory | `command_started` carries `cwd` | No `cwd` on the event |

A build that finishes in a session whose window was closed still lands in
the history, and the toast reaches every window of that pane's window key
when one is open. The window half only does what needs a window: the
command, the key and the status segment. It hears the same events for its
own panes, which is all the segment needs.

### Deciding what is slow

`command_finished` compares `took_ms` with the threshold, read from kv
`threshold_ms` on every event so the block's `+` and `-` keys take effect
at once. A few programs are excluded: an editor, pager, `ssh` session or
REPL runs exactly as long as you use it, and a toast saying "vim finished
in 41m" is noise. `common.interactive` finds the program a command line
runs (skipping `VAR=value` prefixes and wrappers such as `sudo`, `env` and
`time`) and checks it against a list. Interpreters count as interactive only
without a script: `python` is a prompt, `python train.py` is a job.

Durations are written the way people say them: `8.4s` under ten seconds,
`42s`, `1m 12s`, `2h 5m`. A failure toasts with the error tone and puts the
exit status first in the secondary line.

### The history

The history is a Lua array read from kv once, when the host half loads,
and written back whole after every change. Each record keeps the command
line, its directory, `took_ms`, the exit status and `os.time()` at the end,
so the block can show "14:02" for today and "Mar 03 14:02" otherwise. The
newest record is first and the array is trimmed to 50, which keeps
`kv.json` small: kv rewrites the whole file on every `set`.

The `cwd` comes from the `command_started` the hook saw for that pane. When
the plugin loaded mid-command there is none, and `tern.pane.list()` supplies
the pane's current directory instead.

### The block and its clock

The Slow Commands block has two parts: "Running now", the commands at
least a second old with their elapsed times, and the history table. Its
title counts the history ("Slow Commands (12)").

Elapsed times must move, but Tern runs a block's `view` only after one of
its handlers (`init`, `key`, `event`, `resize`), a resize of its pane or a
`cx:render()` call.
The host keeps every open block's `BlockCx` from `init` (a block's `cx`
outlives the call that received it), and `schedule()` arms a one-second
`tern.timer` only while at least one
block is open and at least one command runs. The timer re-renders the
blocks and schedules itself again. Completion or shell exit cancels the
tick immediately when the last command ends; the next tick prunes closed
blocks and stops if none remain. `longrun` runs no timer while nothing is
running.

History and threshold changes call `refresh()` too: clearing in one block
updates every other open block's history and count, and changing the
threshold updates all their labels even when no command runs and no timer
is scheduled. Each view clamps its own selection to the current history.

Plugin blocks get no close callback. `prune()` drops a block whose pane is
no longer in `tern.pane.list()`, but only after two seconds, because `init`
can run before the daemon lists the new pane.

Keys follow the list conventions: `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` select, `Enter`
copies the selected command line, `c` clears the history and `+`/`-`
change the threshold by five seconds. The dock repeats the keys and offers
Copy and Clear badges, whose `actions.click` names arrive in the block's
`event` handler as `{ev = "action", act = ...}`. The `key` handler returns
`true` for every key it acts on and `false` for the rest: an exact `false`
tells Tern the key changed nothing, so it skips the render and the save.

### Opening the block

"Show slow commands" first looks for a pane in this window whose title
starts with "Slow Commands" and focuses it; otherwise
`cx:new_block("longrun.slow", nil, "tab")` opens one. `new_block` returns
`nil` when no loaded plugin on the pane's host defines the kind, for
example a window attached to a remote host where `longrun` isn't
installed, and the command toasts that instead of failing silently.

The manifest sets `palette = false` on the block, so the palette shows only
the command, not a second "New Slow Commands block" row.

### A status segment that ticks

While the focused pane runs a command, the status line shows its program
and how long it has been running, "cargo · 1m 12s", counting up; clicking
it runs `plugin.longrun.show`, which opens the block.

The window half keeps its own `running` table from the window's
`command_started` and `command_finished` events: the program
(`common.program`, so `FOO=1 cargo build` shows `cargo`) and `tern.now()`
at the start. Interactive programs are left out, as in the history. It
refreshes focus with `cx.session:focused()` on every relevant window event,
including `command_started`, rather than relying on a startup event.
Plugin reload can preserve the same focused pane without emitting
`window_start` or `focus`; the next command still starts the clock.

A status formatter is called with `{pane, cwd, program, title, busy}` and
Tern caches its answer per input, but the running time depends on the
clock, which is not part of the input. The segment stays current as follows:

- `schedule()` arms exactly one one-second `tern.timer` while the focused
  pane has an observed running command. The callback receives a fresh
  `WindowCx`; it refreshes focus and checks `cx.session:panes()`, dropping
  runs for absent panes or those whose `busy` snapshot is false. It then
  calls `tern.chrome.refresh()` even if the run ended, erasing the last
  cached segment, and schedules again only if the focused command is live.
- A shell that exits without supplying its next prompt mark may emit no
  window `command_finished`. Its snapshot still becomes idle. The next
  tick detects that and stops; the formatter also immediately hides an
  idle pane's segment when its `busy` input changes. This works even when
  the program and title are unchanged.
- Command completion, pane closure and focus changes reconcile snapshots
  and cancel any unneeded tick immediately. Command start/finish and pane
  closure invalidate chrome, so an earlier run's cached time never shows.
  Focusing an observed running pane starts its clock again.

Contexts are never retained across callbacks. Only live focused commands
drive snapshot checks: an idle window runs no timer, including after a
reload, and the same snapshots work for remote panes.

The formatter returns nothing during a command's first second, so quick
commands don't flash a segment, and writes whole seconds under a minute
(`42s`), then `common.duration`'s `1m 12s` and `2h 5m`. See
[Chrome and Styling](../guides/chrome.md#refreshing) for the rules.

## Limits

- Panes without shell integration report no commands, so nothing is timed.
- The segment times only commands the window half saw start: one already
  running when the window opened or the plugin reloaded shows no segment
  until the next command.
- The history and threshold belong to the daemon's machine
  (`<state>/plugin-data/longrun/kv.json`).
