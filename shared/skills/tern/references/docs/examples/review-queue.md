# Review Queue

`review-queue` keeps the pull requests that wait for your review in a
block: it runs the GitHub CLI's `gh search prs --review-requested=@me`
every two minutes and lists the results with their repository, title,
author, age and draft state. It is the example for a long-lived block fed
by a background process, and for a window command that opens a block.

## What it demonstrates

| Surface | Half | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tern.block.define` with `init`, `title`, `view`, `key`, `event`, `save` | Host | The Review Queue block |
| `tern.process.run` with `timeout_ms` and `env` | Host | Running `gh` off the worker thread |
| `tern.timer`, `TimerHandle:cancel`, `BlockCx:render`, `tern.pane.list` | Host | One polling chain per block run, retired on restart or close |
| `tern.json.decode` | Host | Reading `gh`'s JSON |
| `ui.list` with `selected`, `max` and keyed items | Host | The list, its cursor and click events |
| `ui.card`, `ui.md`, `ui.code`, badge `actions` | Host | Error views with Retry and Install buttons |
| `BlockCx:open` | Host | Opening a pull request in the browser |
| `save` and `init`'s `saved` | Host | Remembering whether drafts show |
| `tern.command`, `tern.bind` | Window | "Open review queue" and its key |
| `cx.session:panes()`, `cx.layout:focus`, `cx:new_block` | Window | Focusing the open queue, or opening one |

## Install

The block runs `gh` on the machine that runs your panes (the daemon's
host), so install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) there and sign
in with `gh auth login`. Then, from where you unpacked
[the SDK](../index.md#the-sdk):

```sh
tern plugin install tern-sdk/examples/review-queue
```

While you change it, link it instead so Tern reloads it on every save:

```sh
tern plugin link tern-sdk/examples/review-queue
```

Press `alt+shift+cmd+r`, or run **Open review queue** from the palette.

## Design

### Running `gh` without blocking

Every call into a host plugin runs on its worker with a 2-second budget,
and a GitHub search can take longer than that. `tern.process.run` starts
the program on a pool thread and returns at once; its callback runs later
on the worker with the result. The block shows a progress bar until the
first answer arrives. Each callback first checks that its state still
belongs to the current run of the block, then ends with `state.cx:render()`,
because Tern only re-runs `view` by itself after a handler.

```lua
tern.process.run(argv, opts, function(result: ProcessResult, _)
	done(result)
end)
```

The options matter for a program started by a daemon:

| Option | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `timeout_ms = 30000` | A hung network call ends as `timed_out` instead of leaving the block "refreshing" forever |
| `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1` | `gh` never waits for an answer on a terminal it doesn't have |
| `GH_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`, `NO_COLOR=1` | stderr stays a plain error message the block can show |

A daemon started by launchd or systemd often has a short `PATH`. The block
tries `gh` by name first, then the usual install locations
(`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, Linuxbrew, `/usr/bin`) that exist
on disk. `tern.process.run` raises when the program cannot be spawned, so
each attempt runs under `pcall`, and only when all of them fail does the
block report that `gh` is missing.

### Polling, and stopping

`init` registers its state in a `running` table keyed by pane ID, starts
the first refresh, and stores a 2-minute `tern.timer` handle. Restart keeps
the same pane ID, so pane existence alone is not a lifetime check: the
state object must also match `running[state.cx.pane]`.

A replacement `init` retires the previous state before registering the new
one: it cancels only the old state's timer and releases its PR list. Every
refresh, process callback and timer callback checks that state identity.
A stale callback cannot update the list, render, start another request, or
rearm a timer; it cannot remove or cancel the replacement's state or timer.

Plugin blocks get no close callback, so a live callback also checks
`tern.pane.list()`. A disappeared pane retires its state and cancels its
pending timer. With no process pending, that cleanup happens at the next
2-minute tick. Already-started processes have no cancellation handle in
this API: they finish or hit the existing 30-second timeout, and their
stale results are ignored.

The timer clears its handle before refreshing and arming the next one,
keeping one pending timer per current run. A `loading` flag keeps manual
refresh (`r`, Retry) from starting a second `gh` while one is running.

### Telling failures apart

A failed run becomes a `Problem` with one of three kinds, each with its
own heading and advice:

| Kind | Detected by | The view says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `missing` | No candidate `gh` could be spawned | "GitHub CLI not found", with an Install guide button |
| `auth` | Exit status 4 (`gh`'s "authentication required"), or stderr mentioning `gh auth login`, `GH_TOKEN` or HTTP 401 | "GitHub CLI not signed in": run `gh auth login`, then press `r` |
| `failed` | Anything else, including a timeout or JSON that isn't a list | "Could not load review requests", with the first lines of stderr |

Before the first successful load, the problem fills the block as a card
with Retry (and, for `missing`, Install guide) buttons. After a list has
loaded once, a later failure keeps the last list on screen and adds the
problem to the dock, since stale data with a warning is more useful than
an error page during a short outage.

### The list

`ui.list` draws the rows; the block then gives every item a `key` of
`owner/repo#number` and the list itself the key `queue`. Node ids are
built from keys, so each row's id is `main.queue.<owner/repo#number>` no
matter how the list reorders on the next poll. That id is what the list's
`selected` prop names and what its `select` (click) and `activate` (double
click) events carry in `ev.item`, so the cursor follows a pull request,
not a position. When the selected pull request disappears, the cursor
moves to the first row.

Two details of how blocks are drawn shape the view:

- A region draws the children of the node `view` returns, not that node
  itself. A list returned directly as `main` would lose its selection and
  events, so `main` is always `ui.col({ … })` around the list, card or
  progress bar.
- A list keeps its selected row in view only when it scrolls itself, which
  it does once it has a `max` height. The block sets
  `max = { lines = … }` from `cx.rows`. It needs no `resize` handler:
  Tern runs `view` again when the pane resizes, and the height follows.

Rows put the repository and number before the title in the label, and the
author and age in the right-aligned value. A list item's `detail` takes
only the space the label leaves, so a long title would hide anything
placed there. Drafts start with a `draft` marker and the muted tone.

The `age` column needs the pull request's creation time as a Unix time.
`gh` prints ISO 8601 in UTC, and Luau's `os.time` with a table reads local
time, so `epoch` converts the date with the days-from-civil algorithm.

### Keys and saved state

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑`/`↓`, `k`/`j` | Move |
| `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Home`/`End`, `g`/`G` | Jump |
| `Enter`, `o` | Open the pull request (`cx:open(url)`) |
| `r` | Refresh now |
| `d` | Show or hide drafts |

The handler ignores keys with Ctrl, Alt or Cmd held, and returns `false`
for keys it doesn't use, so they cost no render and no save; every key it
acts on returns `true`.

Whether drafts show is the block's only saved state: `save` returns
`{drafts = …}` and `init` reads it back from `saved` after a restart. Tern
runs `save` after every handler and stores the result only when it
changed, so the block never calls `cx:save()` itself.

### The window half

The window half adds one palette command and binds it:

```lua
tern.command({ id = "open", title = "Open review queue", icon = "merge", run = open_queue })
tern.bind("alt+shift+cmd+r", "plugin.review-queue.open")
```

Each open queue polls GitHub, so `open_queue` first looks through
`cx.session:panes()` for a pane titled "Review Queue…" and focuses it.
Otherwise `cx:new_block("review-queue.queue", nil, "beside")` opens one
next to the focused pane. `new_block` returns `nil` when the host that
runs the window's panes has no such block type (the plugin is installed
in this window's machine but not on a remote host it is attached to), and
the command says so in a toast. A plugin bind whose chord the keyboard
preset already uses is left out with a warning in the log; see
[Commands, Keys, and Overrides](../guides/commands.md).

## Limits

- The search asks for at most 100 results (`--limit=100`).
- A new review request shows up at the next poll, up to two minutes later,
  or at once with `r`.
- Every open queue polls on its own; the command keeps it to one per
  window, but other windows can open their own.
