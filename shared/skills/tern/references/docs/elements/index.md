# Elements

A view is a tree of nodes, and every node has a kind: `text`, `card`,
`table`, `el`, and so on. Tern draws each kind natively. It lays the node
out, colors it from the theme, animates it and keeps its view state, while
your code only says what is on screen. This part of the book documents
every kind: its props, how it behaves, the events it sends, and the
elements and classes a style sheet can target.

```lua
type Node = {
	k: string,               -- the kind
	p: { [string]: any }?,   -- props
	c: { Node }?,            -- children
}
```

`tern.ui` has builders for the common kinds (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md)),
and `tern.ui.node(kind, props, children)` builds any kind:

```lua
local ui = tern.ui
ui.col({
	ui.card("Deploy", {
		ui.kv({ { "service", "api-gateway" }, { "region", "eu-west-1" } }),
		ui.progress(0.4, "uploading"),
	}),
	ui.row({
		ui.badge("v2.3.1", "accent"),
		ui.node("icon", { name = "success", tone = "success" }),
		ui.node("kbd", { keys = { "cmd", "K" } }),
		ui.node("spinner", { style = "dots", label = { ui.span("Waiting for CI", "muted") } }),
	}),
	ui.rule("log"),
	ui.code('fn main() {\n    println!("deployed");\n}', "rust"),
})
```

How your views reach the screen, how block node ids and keys work, and how
events come back are in [Building Views](../guides/views.md) and
[Blocks](../guides/blocks.md). A program that isn't a plugin sends the same
nodes over the [Surface Protocol](../protocol/index.md). How to style what
these pages describe is in [Styling Views](../styles/index.md).

"In order" means Tern draws the node's children one after another inside
it. "Placed by" means the kind decides where each child goes, such as a
card putting its head child in the header row. Children of a kind marked
"none" are ignored.

Text kinds (`text`, `md`, `code`, `ansi`, `math`, `editor`, `input`,
`shimmer`, `el`) keep their text in the `text` prop. In a block view, a
`text` prop that grows by a suffix goes to the window as an append, so
streaming long output costs only the new bytes (see
[Host API](../reference/api-host.md#view-model)).

## Props every node takes

These work on every kind, in addition to the kind's own props.

| Prop | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | string | Identity among siblings in a block view. It keeps the node's id, and with it Tern's view state for the node (collapsed, scroll, control state), across reorders. Two siblings with the same key are an error (`duplicate child key`) |
| `role` | string | A name of yours, exposed to CSS as `data-role`. Use names under your plugin id (`myplugin.row`) |
| `tone` | `neutral`, `accent`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `pending`, `muted`, `user` | The semantic color of the node's chrome (a card's ring, a badge's pill, a spinner, a progress fill, a list row's icon). Exposed as `data-tone`, which sets the tone color `--tc` on the element; other values are ignored |
| `hidden` | boolean | Keeps the node mounted but not laid out (class `sf-hidden`, `display: none`). Cheaper than removing and adding it again |
| `mark` | `pick`, `drop` | Transient selection drawn over the node without restyling it, exposed as `data-mark`: `pick` draws an accent bar at the node's left, `drop` dims it. Other strings only set the attribute |
| `actions` | `{click?, dblclick?, menu?}` | What a pointer does: `menu` lists the actions a right-click offers, followed by Copy when you don't list `copy`. See [Actions and events](../guides/views.md#actions-and-events). A node with a click or double-click action gets class `sf-act` |
| `title` | string | A tooltip |
| `aria` | string | The accessible name of a node that shows no text (`aria-label`). It replaces the name a kind gives itself (a `kbd`'s spoken keys) |
| `href` | string | A link for the node: ⌘-click opens it, and the `copy` and `open` actions use it. Exposed as `data-href` |
| `grow`, `shrink` | number | Flex grow and shrink inside a `row` or `col` |
| `basis` | number or `"content"` | Flex basis: a fraction of the parent (`0.5` is half), or `"content"` for the node's own size without shrinking |
| `min`, `max` | `{w?, h?}` | Size bounds. Each is `"<n>ch"` (character cells), `"<n>lines"` (text lines) or a number as a fraction of the parent (`0.5` is half); negative or other values are ignored. Never pixels, so a view scales with the font. A `max.h` also clips the node (class `sf-clip`, `overflow: hidden`). A `seg`'s `min.w` sets no CSS bound: it is how far the status strip lets the segment truncate ([`seg`](chrome.md#seg)) |

Tone across kinds, as the badge, spinner, progress and card kinds draw it:

```lua
local rows = {}
for _, tone in ipairs({ "neutral", "accent", "info", "success", "warning", "error", "pending", "muted", "user" }) do
	table.insert(rows, ui.row({
		ui.node("badge", { text = tone, tone = tone, min = { w = "9ch" } }),
		ui.node("spinner", { style = "dots", tone = tone }),
		ui.node("progress", { value = 0.6, tone = tone, grow = 1 }),
	}))
end
local function card(tone, note)
	local c = ui.card(tone, { ui.text({ ui.span(note, "muted") }) })
	c.p.tone, c.p.grow, c.p.basis = tone, 1, 0.3
	return c
end
table.insert(rows, ui.row({ card("success", "passed"), card("error", "2 failed"), card("info", "cached") }))
return ui.col(rows)
```

</figure>

Your own sheet can use the tone color too: any node with a `tone`, an
`el` included, has `--tc` set, so `color: var(--tc)` follows it.

`collapsible` and `collapsed` are props of `card` and `section` (and of
the tool and agent kinds); see [Layout](layout.md#card).

## What a node becomes

Every node below a region root becomes one element in the window's
document:

```html
<div class="sf sf-card" data-id="main.0" data-role="deploy.summary" data-tone="success">
	<!-- the kind's own parts, then its children -->
</div>
```

- The element is a `div`. Inline kinds (`badge`, `kbd`, `icon`,
  `spinner`, `shimmer`, `elapsed`, `rate`, `effort`) are a `span`. An
  `el` uses its `tag`, except that a `form` or an unknown tag is a `div`
  and a checkbox or radio `input` is a `span`.
- Classes `sf` and `sf-<kind>` are always there. `data-id` is the node's
  id. Some kinds add classes and attributes of their own to the element
  (`kbds` and `role="img"` on a `kbd`, `role="progressbar"` on a
  `progress`).
- The common props add `data-role`, `data-tone`, `data-mark`,
  `data-href`, `title` and `aria-label`, and the classes `sf-hidden`,
  `sf-act` and `sf-clip`. The flex and size props become the element's
  inline style.
- Inside, each kind builds its own parts with classes such as
  `.sf-card-head`. The kind pages list them. They are Tern's structure and
  may change between versions. Style by kind, role, tone and your own `el`
  classes where you can.

The region roots (`main`, `dock`, `layer`) don't get elements of their
own. Their children go into three region elements, one per region:

```html
<div class="sf-region sf-main" data-scope="sf1" data-surface="plugin.deploy.status" data-role="deploy.main">
	<!-- the elements of main's children -->
</div>
```

- Classes `sf-region` and `sf-main`, `sf-dock` or `sf-layer`, plus
  state classes of Tern's own (`sf-unfocused` while the window isn't
  focused, `sf-h-annotated` while markdown headings stay body size).
- `data-scope` is the view's scope token (`sf<N>`). Tern confines a
  program's style sheets to the regions carrying it.
- `data-surface` is the surface's role: `plugin.<plugin>.<block>` for a
  block. It is absent when the surface has no role.
- `data-role` is the region root's `role` prop.

See [Styling Views](../styles/index.md) for every hook, the cascade and
recipes.

## Mistakes

Tern checks each node when it arrives. An unknown kind, an op on a node
that doesn't exist, or an `el` with an unknown tag is rejected or drawn as
a plain `div`, and reported with an `error` event. Those events don't
reach a block's `event` handler, which only hears user events, so when a
node doesn't show up, list the block's elements with the control socket's
`tree` command (`tree "[data-surface='plugin.<plugin>.<block>']"`, see
[Debugging](../guides/debugging.md)). The `tern.ui` builders catch most
mistakes earlier and raise with the argument's path.
