# Progress and Motion

These kinds show work in progress and quantities. Tern runs every animation itself, so your plugin never sends
frames: it sends a `spinner`, a `shimmer` or an `elapsed` once, and Tern keeps it moving until the node changes or
goes away. Reach for `spinner` or `shimmer` to say "busy", `elapsed` for a running timer, `rate` for a throughput
number, `progress` for a known (or unknown) fraction done, `meter` for a level such as usage or a split of a whole,
`chart` for a series, and `effort` for omp's thinking-effort glyph.

| Kind | Builder | Draws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`spinner`](#spinner) | `tern.ui.node("spinner", …)` | An activity indicator with an optional label |
| [`shimmer`](#shimmer) | `tern.ui.node("shimmer", …)` | Text with a light sweeping across it |
| [`elapsed`](#elapsed) | `tern.ui.node("elapsed", …)` | A live timer or countdown (`12.3s`, `4:05`) |
| [`rate`](#rate) | `tern.ui.node("rate", …)` | A number that eases to each new value (`42.3 tok/s`) |
| [`progress`](#progress) | `tern.ui.progress(value, label)` | A progress bar, determinate or indeterminate |
| [`meter`](#meter) | `tern.ui.meter(value, label)` | A value or stacked parts as a bar, ring or block grid |
| [`chart`](#chart) | `tern.ui.bars(…)`, `tern.ui.spark(…)` | A heatmap, a bar chart or a sparkline |
| [`effort`](#effort) | `tern.ui.node("effort", …)` | A ring that fills by thinking-effort level |

All of these kinds have no children: Tern ignores any you pass. All accept the common props (`id`, `role`, `tone`,
`title`, `aria`, `actions`, …) described in [Elements](index.md).

## How Tern clocks motion

There are two kinds of clock.

- **CSS keyframes.** Spinners, shimmer, the indeterminate progress bar, the effort fire, chart arrivals and meter
  fills are CSS animations and transitions on the document clock. Each kind's keyframe names are listed in its
  **Styling** section. You can restyle them or replace them with your own `@keyframes` (see
  [Supported CSS](../styles/css.md)).
- **The view's tick.** `elapsed` and `rate` change their *text*, so the view keeps a clock for each one. It redraws
  a timer only when its text changes: every 100 ms below a minute in `short` format, otherwise every second. It
  redraws a rate about every 16 ms while the rate is easing. A stopped timer, a finished countdown or a settled rate
  asks for no frames at all.

Time travels as **ages**, never as wall-clock timestamps. `elapsed.age` is how many milliseconds had already passed
when you built the node. Tern sets the start to "time the age arrived − age", so a redraw, a late mount or a replay
after reattaching still shows the right time.

### Hidden, covered and reduced motion

Tern puts state classes on each region (`.sf-main`, `.sf-dock`, `.sf-layer`):

| Class | When | Effect on motion kinds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.sf-paused` | The surface isn't visible | Spinner, shimmer and effort keyframes stop (`animation: none`; shimmer text holds its low color); the Spindle mark holds its rest frame |
| `.sf-still` | Tern's Reduce Motion setting is on (it follows the system's by default; you can force it on or off) | As `.sf-paused`, and more: see the table below |
| `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` | The system setting is on | The same as `.sf-still` (Tern's base sheet also zeroes every animation and transition duration) |

Some things are not CSS, so Tern also reads Reduce Motion while it renders. A `meter` or `effort` then draws its
value at once, without the first-show sweep.

What each kind shows under reduced motion:

| Kind | Reduced motion |
| --- | --- |
| `spinner` | The indicator's first frame stays still; the label stays |
| `shimmer` | Plain text in the inherited color (`color: inherit`), no sweep |
| `elapsed` | Keeps ticking (it is text, not motion) |
| `rate` | Keeps updating, and still eases: the ease runs on the view's tick, not in CSS |
| `progress` | Determinate: the fill moves at once under the system setting (it zeroes the transition); under `.sf-still` alone it still eases over 0.3 s. Indeterminate: a full-width fill at 35% opacity |
| `meter` | No first-show grow; later bar and ring values jump instead of easing (`transition: none`). Block cells still fade over 0.3 s unless the system setting is on |
| `chart` | Heatmap columns and bars appear at once (no `omp-cell`/`omp-bar` arrival) |
| `effort` | No sweep or cross-fade; at `max` the fire shows but doesn't flicker |

Under a sheet (for example a modal picker), Tern adds `.sf-covered`. Every animation under it holds its frame until
the sheet goes away.

## `spinner`

An inline activity indicator, optionally followed by a label. It sizes to its content and never shrinks
(`flex: none`). The indicator is colored by `tone`, or the accent color without one. The label uses the text color.

An unlabeled spinner has no gap after the indicator, because its label element stays hidden (`.sf-hidden`) until it
has spans. If you don't set `aria`, the spinner gets `role="img"` and `aria-label` set to the label's plain text, or
`"Working"` without a label.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("spinner", { style = "dots", label = "Fetching" })`. There is no dedicated builder.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `style` | `"braille"` \| `"dots"` \| `"starburst"` \| `"orbit"` | `"braille"` | The indicator. An unknown value draws `braille` |
| `label` | Spans (a string or a span list) | none | Text after the indicator. Span tokens and `fx` work as in [`text`](text.md) |
| `tone` | Tone | accent | Color of the indicator (`[data-tone]`) |
| `aria` | string | label text or `"Working"` | Accessible name. Setting it also drops the automatic `role="img"` |

The styles:

| `style` | Draws | Loop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `braille` | `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`, one glyph at a time in a one-line window | `sf-strip`, 1 s, 10 steps |
| `starburst` | `·✢✳✶✻✽✻✶✳✢`, omp's thinking glyph | `sf-strip`, 1.2 s, 10 steps |
| `dots` | Three dots pulsing one after another | `sf-dot`, 1.2 s, delays 0 / 0.16 / 0.32 s |
| `orbit` | A dot circling a faint ring | `sf-turn`, 0.9 s, 12 steps |

A `starburst` spinner whose parent has `role = "omp.working"` (omp's working row) draws the Stencil Spindle mark
instead (`span.sf-spindle`). Tern paints that one natively, not with CSS keyframes. This is meant for omp. A plugin
can reach it by using that role on the parent, but you should use the documented styles.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<span class="sf sf-spinner" data-id="…" data-tone="info" role="img" aria-label="Fetching">
	<!-- braille / starburst -->
	<span class="sf-spin braille" aria-hidden="true">
		<span class="strip"><span>⠋</span><span>⠙</span>…</span>
	</span>
	<!-- dots:     <span class="sf-dots" aria-hidden="true"><i></i><i></i><i></i></span> -->
	<!-- orbit:    <span class="sf-orbit" aria-hidden="true"><i></i></span> -->
	<!-- Spindle:  <span class="sf-spindle" aria-hidden="true"></span> -->
	<span class="lbl">Fetching</span>
</span>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-spinner` |
| By tone | `.sf-spinner[data-tone='success']` |
| Frame window (braille, starburst) | `.sf-spin`, `.sf-spin.braille`, `.sf-spin.starburst` (inner, may change) |
| Frame strip, the animated element | `.sf-spin .strip` (inner, may change) |
| Dots | `.sf-dots > i` (inner, may change) |
| Orbit ring and its dot | `.sf-orbit`, `.sf-orbit > i` (inner, may change) |
| Spindle mark | `.sf-spindle` (inner, may change) |
| Label | `.sf-spinner .lbl` (inner, may change) |

The keyframes are `sf-strip` (translates the strip up by 100%), `sf-dot` and `sf-turn`. The indicator reads
`--tc` (the tone color) or `--accent`. The label reads `--tv-fg` with `--t1` as the fallback. The frame window is
`1.2em` wide and `--sf-lh` tall. The Spindle mark draws in `currentColor`, and `--sf-spindle: still` holds its rest
frame.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.col({
	ui.node("row", { gap = "lg" }, {
		ui.node("spinner", { label = "braille" }),
		ui.node("spinner", { style = "starburst", label = "starburst" }),

	}),
	ui.node("spinner", { style = "dots", tone = "info", label = { ui.span("Syncing ", ""), ui.span("3 repos", "muted") } }),
})

## `shimmer`

A label with a highlight that sweeps across it, character by character. Use it for a "working" message. Tern
splits the text into one `span.sf-sh` per character. Each character's animation starts `--i × 45ms` after the
first, so the highlight travels left to right. The text keeps its whitespace (`white-space: pre`). The node's
`aria-label` is the plain text, so screen readers read the words and not the letters.

The same effect is available on any span as `fx = "shimmer"` (see [Text](text.md)).

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("shimmer", { text = "Thinking…" })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spans` | span list | none | Styled text. Takes precedence over `text` when it is an array |
| `text` | string | none | Plain text, used when `spans` isn't an array |
| `mode` | `"classic"` \| `"kitt"` | `"classic"` | `classic` sweeps left to right and restarts. `kitt` bounces back and forth (`animation-direction: alternate`, class `.kitt`) |
| `palette` | `{ low?, mid?, high? }` of span tokens | theme text colors | The three sweep colors. Each value's first span token sets `--sh-lo` / `--sh-mid` / `--sh-hi` to `var(--sf-c-<token>)`. Use a color token (`muted`, `dim`, `accent`, `info`, `success`, …); omp theme tokens map to theirs (`toolDiffAdded` → `ins`). A missing key, an unknown token or a token that names no color (`strong`) falls back to the default |

Each span's style tokens become `sf-t-<token>` classes on a wrapper around that span's characters. The sweep sets
`color` on each character, so a color token on a span is overridden while the sweep runs. Other tokens, such as
`strong`, still apply.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<span class="sf sf-shimmer kitt" data-id="…" aria-label="Thinking…">
	<span class="sf-t-strong">
		<span class="sf-sh" style="--i: 0">T</span><span class="sf-sh" style="--i: 1">h</span>…
	</span>
</span>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-shimmer` |
| Bouncing mode | `.sf-shimmer.kitt` |
| One character | `.sf-shimmer .sf-sh` (inner, may change) |

The keyframe is `sf-sh`: 2.25 s, `steps(7)`, infinite. It runs from `--sh-lo` to `--sh-hi` at 14%, `--sh-mid` at
28%, and back to `--sh-lo` from 42% on. The defaults are `--t3`, `--t1` and `--t2` (see
[Variables](../styles/variables.md)). You can set `--sh-lo`, `--sh-mid` and `--sh-hi` from your sheet instead of
using `palette`:

```css
[data-role='plugin.deploy.status'] .sf-shimmer {
	--sh-hi: var(--accent);
}
```

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.node("shimmer", {
	text = "Deploying to staging…",
	mode = "kitt",
	palette = { low = "muted", mid = "info", high = "accent" },

## `elapsed`

A live timer that counts up from an age, or down to zero. The text uses tabular figures, doesn't wrap, and is drawn
in `--t3`. It has `role="timer"`.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("elapsed", { age = ms })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `age` | number (ms) | `0` | Milliseconds already elapsed when you built the node. A negative age is a countdown that ends that many ms after it arrives |
| `stopped` | number (ms) | none | Freezes the display at this many ms. The timer no longer ticks |
| `format` | `"short"` \| `"clock"` | `"short"` | How the time reads. An unknown value reads as `short` |

Formats (negative values show as zero):

| Shown time | `short` | `clock` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| under 1 min | `12.3s` (tenths, rounded down so it never runs ahead) | `0:12` |
| under 1 h | `4m 05s` | `4:05` |
| 1 h or more | `1h 02m` | `1:02:03` |

How ages work:

- A positive `age` shows `age` plus the time since that `age` value arrived. Each `age` that arrives (in a new node
  or in a `set` that includes it) re-anchors the count, even when the number is unchanged. A `set` of other props
  leaves the count running. So compute `age` from your own start time whenever you send it
  (`(os.clock() - started) * 1000`, or the equivalent from your plugin's time source).
- A negative `age` counts down from `-age` ms and stops at `0:00` / `0.0s`. It is anchored the same way: it ends
  `-age` ms after that `age` value arrived, a `set` of other props leaves it running, and a new `age` (even the
  same number) starts it over. Once it reaches zero it stays there.
- `stopped` shows a fixed duration, for example the final time of a finished job.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<span class="sf sf-elapsed" data-id="…" role="timer">4m 05s</span>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-elapsed` |

It has no keyframes. Reduced motion doesn't stop it.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.col({
	ui.row({ ui.text("build"), ui.node("elapsed", { age = 12345 }) }),
	ui.row({ ui.text("tests"), ui.node("elapsed", { stopped = 18400 }) }),
	ui.row({ ui.text("retry in"), ui.node("elapsed", { age = -30000, format = "clock" }) }),
})

<figcaption>Drawn about 1.5 s after the frame arrived: the running timer and the countdown have moved on from their ages; the stopped one hasn't.</figcaption>
</figure>

## `rate`

A number that eases to each new value instead of jumping. Use it for throughput such as tokens per second. When you
send a new `value`, the display eases from what it shows now to the new value over 420 ms (ease-out cubic). The
first value shows at once. The text has one decimal below 100 and none from 100 up, followed by a space and `unit`
when you set one (`42.3 tok/s`, `1234`).

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("rate", { value = 42.26, unit = "tok/s" })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | number | `0` | The target value |
| `unit` | string | none | Appended after a space |

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<span class="sf sf-rate" data-id="…">42.3 tok/s</span>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-rate` |

It uses tabular figures, doesn't wrap, and is drawn in `--t2`. The node needs a stable `id` to ease: a node with a
new id starts over at its value.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.row({ ui.text("download"), ui.node("rate", { id = "dl-rate", value = state.mbps, unit = "MB/s" }) })
```

## `progress`

A horizontal bar with an optional label after it. With a `value`, the fill shows that fraction and moves to a new
value over 0.3 s. Without one (`nil`/`null`), the bar is **indeterminate**: a 30%-wide fill slides across the track.
The node has `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuemin` 0 and `aria-valuemax` 100. `aria-valuenow` is the rounded
percentage, and it is absent while indeterminate. The track grows to fill the row (minimum 40 px). The label is
hidden while it's empty.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.progress(value, label)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#progress)), or
`tern.ui.node("progress", { value = 0.4, label = "40%" })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | number 0–1, or `nil` | `nil` (indeterminate) | Fraction done. Clamped to 0–1 and rounded to whole percent |
| `label` | Spans | none | Text after the bar, in tabular figures |
| `tone` | Tone | accent | Fill color. `neutral` uses the accent too |

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<div class="sf sf-progress indeterminate" data-id="…" role="progressbar" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">
	<div class="track"><div class="fill"></div></div>
	<span class="lbl">Uploading…</span>
</div>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-progress` |
| Indeterminate | `.sf-progress.indeterminate` |
| Track | `.sf-progress .track` (inner, may change) |
| Fill | `.sf-progress .fill` (inner, may change) |
| Label | `.sf-progress .lbl` (inner, may change) |

The keyframe is `sf-indet` (1.3 s, `steps(16)`, `translateX(-100%)` → `translateX(340%)`). The track is 4 px tall
on `--l2`. The fill uses `--tc`, or `--accent` without a tone. Under reduced motion an indeterminate bar becomes a
full-width fill at 35% opacity.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.col({
	ui.progress(0.4, "40%"),
	ui.node("progress", { value = 0.85, tone = "success", label = "85%" }),
	ui.progress(nil, "Preparing…"), -- indeterminate
})

## `meter`

A level drawn as a **bar** (the default), a **ring** or a **block grid**. It shows one `value`, or stacked `parts`
that split a whole (for example used / cached / free). Thresholds color it `warn` or `bad`. Ticks (`marks`) can
point out a limit on the track.

The shape comes from `style`. Tern never picks it from the value:

| `style` | Shape | `size` `sm` / `md` / `lg` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bar` (default, also any unknown value) | A rounded track that grows along its row (`flex: 1 1 60px`; stretched across in a column) | 4 / 6 / 10 px tall |
| `ring` | A 16-unit SVG ring filling clockwise from 12 o'clock | 12 / 16 / 24 px |
| `blocks` | A grid of 8 px squares, 10 columns. With `steps`, one row of that many slim bars instead | 2 / 5 / 10 rows (20 / 50 / 100 cells) |

On first show a bar or ring fill grows from zero over 0.6 s (`meter-fill`, a Web Animation, not a CSS keyframe).
Later values ease over 0.4 s (CSS transitions on `width`/`left`, or `stroke-dasharray` for rings). Block cells
don't grow; they change color over 0.3 s. Under reduced motion it draws the value at once.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.meter(value, label)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#meter)), or
`tern.ui.node("meter", { … })` for the props below. `tern.ui.test_summary(…)` builds a row with a stacked meter
(see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#test_summary)). Table cells take a meter too (`tern.ui.meter_cell`,
`meter_parts_cell`, see [Data](data.md)).

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | number 0–1 | none | The level. Clamped to 0–1. Ignored for drawing when `parts` is given, but still used for `thresholds` |
| `parts` | `{ { value, token?, label?, hatch? } }` | none | Stacked parts, left to right (clockwise on a ring). See below |
| `thresholds` | `{ warn?: number, bad?: number }` | none | `value ≥ bad` sets `data-level="bad"`, else `value ≥ warn` sets `data-level="warn"`. Needs `value` |
| `style` | `"bar"` \| `"ring"` \| `"blocks"` | `"bar"` | The shape |
| `size` | `"sm"` \| `"md"` \| `"lg"` | `"sm"` | See the shape table. Any other value reads as `sm` |
| `steps` | integer 1–20 | none | `blocks` only: one row of exactly this many cells (`data-steps`). Out-of-range values are ignored |
| `marks` | `{ { at, tone?, title?, icon? } }` | none | Ticks at `at` (0–1, required). See below |
| `label` | Spans | none | Text after the shape, usually the value (`72%`) |
| `total` | Spans | none | Text after the label, usually the whole (`200K`), dimmer |
| `tone` | Tone | accent | Fill color. Wins over the threshold level (`neutral` doesn't) |
| `title` | string | parts summary | Tooltip. Without it, a meter with labeled parts gets `used 42% · cache 8%` |

`parts` entries:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | number | The part's share of the whole. Parts are clamped in order so they never sum past 1: a part that would overflow is cut, and later parts get 0 |
| `token` | string | Color: a span token (`success`, `error`, `muted`, …) or a program palette token (`toolDiffAdded`, …). The fill takes the color text in that token draws in. `"track"` is a gap: the part keeps its place but draws as empty track |
| `label` | string | The part's tooltip, also used in the meter's default `title` |
| `hatch` | boolean | Diagonal hatching over the fill, for reserved or estimated parts |

`marks` entries:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `at` | number 0–1 | Position on the track, clamped to 0–1. A mark without `at` is dropped |
| `tone` | Tone | Tick color (`data-tone` on the tick) |
| `title` | string | Tooltip (bar ticks only) |
| `icon` | icon name | Bar only. Draws the icon on the track and breaks the track and fills around it, `--sf-mt-gap` wide (default 14 px). See [`icon` in Data](data.md) for icon names |

On a ring, marks are short radial ticks. Block grids ignore marks. In a block grid, the parts fill cells in order.
Each part gets its rounded share, and the total matches the rounded sum.

The node has `role="meter"` with `aria-valuemin` 0 and `aria-valuemax` 100. `aria-valuenow` is the rounded
percentage of `value` (or of the parts' sum). It also sets `--sf-meter` to the value (0–1) on the node, so a sheet
can draw its own meter. Without `value` or `parts`, the node gets class `unknown` and a dashed track.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

Variables: `--mt` is the fill color. It is `--accent` by default, `--warn` or `--bad` by level, and `--tc` when the
node has a non-neutral tone. Override `--mt` to recolor every shape at once. Tracks use `--l2` (`--l3` for rings and
stepped cells). The label is `--t3`, the total `--t4`. `--sf-mt-gap` sets the width of an icon mark's break.
`--sf-meter` is the value, set by Tern. The meter rules live in the `omp-composer.css` sheet, but they aren't
scoped to omp and apply to every surface.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.col({
	ui.node("meter", {
		value = 0.84,
		thresholds = { warn = 0.8, bad = 0.95 },
		label = "84%",

## `chart`

Series data drawn by Tern: a **heatmap** (a calendar-style grid of cells), a **bar** chart or a **spark**line of thin
bars. Tern rebuilds the whole chart when any prop changes, so keep charts small (a year heatmap is 371 cells). The
node has `role="figure"`. With a `summary`, its plain text becomes the `aria-label` and a summary line appears
under the chart.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.bars(series)` and `tern.ui.spark(series)` (see
[UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#bars-spark)). For a heatmap, or for `summary`, `size` or `token`, use
`tern.ui.node("chart", { … })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `"heatmap"` \| `"bars"` \| `"spark"` | `"heatmap"` | Which chart. Any other value draws a heatmap |
| `size` | `"sm"` \| `"md"` \| `"lg"` | `"md"` | Heatmap cells 8 / 11 / 13 px. Bars 2 / 4 / 8 lines tall. A spark is always one line tall. Any other value draws as `md` |
| `token` | span or palette token | `accent` | Fill color, set as `--chart-c` (`accent` uses the program palette's accent if it has one) |
| `summary` | Spans | none | A line under the chart and its accessible name |
| `series` | `{ { value, label?, title? } }` | none | `bars`/`spark`: one bar per entry, in order. Heights are relative to the largest value; a zero, negative or missing value draws a 1 px stub. Bars are at most 24 px wide (spark: 4 px) and share the row's width. Tooltip is `title`, else `label` |
| `cells` | `{ { number? } }` (rows of columns) | none | `heatmap`: rows of intensity values 0–1. The widest row sets the column count |
| `tips` | `{ { string? } }` | none | `heatmap`: a tooltip per cell, indexed like `cells` |
| `rows` | `{ string }` | none | `heatmap`: a label per row (`"Mon"`, `""`, `"Wed"`, …) |
| `cols` | `{ { at, label } }` | none | `heatmap`: column labels (months) placed above column `at` (a 0-based whole number). Entries missing either field are skipped |

A heatmap cell's value maps to a level (`data-l`): `≤ 0` → `0` (the empty swatch), `≤ 0.25` → `1`, `≤ 0.5` → `2`,
`≤ 0.75` → `3`, above that → `4`. A non-number or a missing cell is `n`, drawn transparent. The four levels fill
with `--chart-c` at 20%, 40%, 65% and 100%.

Note that the builders send `series` entries as `{ value, label }` objects. A Luau table you pass to `tern.ui.node`
must use those field names too: positional `{ label, value }` pairs only work through `tern.ui.bars`/`spark`.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

local latency = { 2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 6, 4, 7, 10, 8, 6, 9 }
local series = {}
for i, v in latency do
	series[i] = { value = v }
end

return ui.col({
	ui.node("chart", {
		kind = "bars",
		size = "sm",
		series = {
			{ value = 3, label = "Mon" }, { value = 7, label = "Tue" }, { value = 5, label = "Wed" },
			{ value = 9, label = "Thu" }, { value = 4, label = "Fri" }, { value = 1, label = "Sat" },
			{ value = 2, label = "Sun" },
		},
	}),
	ui.node("chart", { kind = "spark", token = "success", series = series, summary = "p95 latency, last 15 min" }),
})
```

Variables: `--chart-c` (fill), `--cell` and `--gap` (heatmap cell size and spacing), `--p` (a cell's fill percentage
by level), `--at` (a month label's column), `--x` (column or bar index, used for the stagger), `--v` (a bar's height
as a fraction). Keyframes: `omp-cell` fades each heatmap column in, staggered 8 ms per column. `omp-bar` grows
each bar from the bottom over 0.6 s, staggered 20 ms per bar (capped at 24). Because Tern rebuilds the chart on
every change, these arrivals replay whenever the props change. The chart rules live in
`omp-panels.css` and apply to every surface.

## `effort`

The thinking-effort glyph of omp's composer chip. It is built for omp, but any plugin can show it. It draws a
14 px ring that fills clockwise one sixth per level, in that level's palette color. At `max` the ring closes and
"catches fire": a crown of flames rises off it with an ember inside, both flickering. Any other level (for example
`auto` before it resolves) draws a dashed empty ring and sets class `unknown`.

When the level changes, the arc sweeps to the new fill and the fire cross-fades (CSS transitions). On first show
the arc sweeps from empty over 0.6 s. Under reduced motion, `.sf-still` or `.sf-paused`, the fire holds still.
Under reduced motion there is also no sweep.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("effort", { level = "high" })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `level` | `"off"` \| `"minimal"` \| `"low"` \| `"medium"` \| `"high"` \| `"xhigh"` \| `"max"` | none | The rung: 0/6 through 6/6. Anything else is unresolved |
| `aria` | string | `"Thinking effort"` | Accessible name |

| Level | Fill | Arc color | Without a program palette |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `off` | empty | `thinkingOff` | (no arc) |
| `minimal` | 1/6 | `thinkingMinimal` | `muted` |
| `low` | 2/6 | `thinkingLow` | `info` |
| `medium` | 3/6 | `thinkingMedium` | `accent` |
| `high` | 4/6 | `thinkingHigh` | `warning` |
| `xhigh` | 5/6 | `thinkingXhigh` | `error` |
| `max` | full, on fire | `thinkingMax` | `error` (mixed into the fire) |

The colors are program palette tokens (`var(--sf-p-thinking<Level>, …)`), falling back to the span token color
in the last column (`--sf-c-<token>`). At `max` the track and arc fade out and a ring stroked with the fire
gradient takes their place. The node has `role="meter"`, `aria-valuemin` 0, `aria-valuemax` 6, `aria-valuenow`
the rung (0 when unresolved) and `aria-valuetext` the level.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<span class="sf sf-effort" data-id="…" data-level="max" role="meter" aria-valuenow="6" aria-valuetext="max">
	<svg class="sf-eff" viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true">

		<path class="crown"/>
		<circle class="track"/>
		<circle class="arc"/>
		<circle class="blaze"/>
		<path class="ember"/>
	</svg>
</span>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-effort` |
| By level | `.sf-effort[data-level='high']` |
| Unresolved | `.sf-effort.unknown` |
| Glyph | `.sf-eff` (inner, may change) |

| Fire gradient stops | `.sf-eff .lo`, `.sf-eff .hi` (inner, may change) |

Variables: `--fire` (the gradient's low stop, mixed from `--sf-p-thinkingMax` or `--bad`) and `--fire-hi` (the high
stop, `#ffc24a`). The track is `--l3`. Keyframes: `sf-flame` (the crown, 1.4 s, `steps(4)`) and `sf-ember` (0.9 s,
`steps(9)`, alternate), both starting 0.5 s after the level reaches `max`.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

local levels = { "off", "minimal", "low", "medium", "high", "xhigh", "max", "auto" }
