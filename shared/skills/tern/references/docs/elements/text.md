# Text and Code

These kinds put words on screen: styled spans, Markdown, highlighted code, diffs, raw terminal output and
formulas. Use `text` for labels and short lines you style span by span, `md` for anything a person wrote in
Markdown, `code` for a file or snippet, `diff` for a change, `ansi` for a program's output as a terminal would
show it, and `math` for one TeX formula.

| Kind | Builder | Draws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`text`](#text) | `tern.ui.text(spans)` | Styled spans that wrap, clamp or truncate |
| [`md`](#md) | `tern.ui.md(text)` | Markdown in omp's dialect: callouts, tables, tasks, math, mermaid |
| [`code`](#code) | `tern.ui.code(text, lang?, start?)` | A highlighted code block with optional line numbers and marks |
| [`diff`](#diff) | `tern.ui.diff(text, path?)` | A unified or side-by-side diff with word-level emphasis |
| [`ansi`](#ansi) | `tern.ui.ansi(text)` | Program output (SGR colors, OSC 8 links) in a mini terminal |
| [`rows`](#rows) | `tern.ui.node("rows", …)` | Pre-rendered terminal rows at a fixed width (migration fallback) |
| [`math`](#math) | `tern.ui.node("math", …)` | One typeset TeX formula, inline or display |

All of them draw no children: children you give them are ignored. Every node element is
`<div class="sf sf-<kind>" data-id="…">`, and the [common props](index.md) (`key`, `tone`, `role`, `title`,
`min`/`max`, `actions`, …) work on each. Text in these kinds is set in the terminal's monospace face at
`--sf-fs`/`--sf-lh` and is selectable.

Stable hooks for your sheet: `.sf-<kind>`, `[data-id]`, `[data-role]`, `[data-tone]`, `[data-mark]`,
`[data-href]`, the `.sf-t-<token>` span classes, `.sf-link`, `.sf-fx-*`, `.tk-*`, and the region's
`[data-surface]`. Every other class below is Tern's inner structure: it is listed so you can style it, but it
is inner and may change between versions. See [Styling views](../styles/index.md) for scoping and the cascade,
[CSS variables](../styles/variables.md) for `--sf-c-*`, `--t1`…`--t4`, `--code-bg` and friends, and
[Supported CSS](../styles/css.md) for what a sheet may use.

## Text kinds and text ops

`text`, `md`, `code`, `ansi` and `math` are *text kinds*: their primary text is the `text` prop, and the
`text` and `splice` ops of the protocol address it (so do `editor`, `input`, `shimmer` and `el`; see
[Inputs](input.md), [Motion](motion.md) and [`el`](el.md)). `diff` and `rows` are not text kinds.

| Op | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `text append <s>` | Appends `s` to the `text` string (sets it when `text` was absent or not a string) |
| `text replace <s>` | Sets `text` to `s` |
| `splice <at> <del> <s>` | Replaces `del` UTF-16 units at offset `at` of `text` with `s`; a range outside the text or splitting a surrogate pair is an error |

You never send ops from a plugin. You return a whole view; when a text kind's `text` prop grew by a suffix
since the last view, Tern sends it to the renderer as an append (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#text-and-code)).
The renderers make appends cheap: `md` re-parses only from the last changed top-level block, `code` keeps the
highlighting of unchanged lines, and `ansi` feeds only the new tail to its terminal. Streaming into `text`
works only for the `text` prop: a `text` node with `spans` draws its spans and ignores `text`.

## `text`

Draws a run of styled spans. The text wraps by word by default; it can wrap anywhere, stay on one line, be
clamped to a number of lines, or be cut at the end, the start or the middle. Wrapping is CSS. Clamping and
truncation are computed by Tern after layout, from the element's width: a cut ends in `…`, and the cut node
gets the full text as its tooltip (`title`) unless you set `title` yourself. When the width changes, Tern shows
the full spans again, measures, and cuts anew.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.text(spans)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#nodes-and-spans)), which emits
`{k = "text", p = {spans = …}}`. With `tern.ui.span`, `tern.ui.link` and `tern.ui.path` you build the spans.
Or `tern.ui.node("text", { text = "One style", wrap = "none" })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spans` | `Spans` (list of span tables and strings) | none | The styled runs. When `spans` is a list it wins over `text` |
| `text` | string | `""` | Plain text, one unstyled span. Used only when `spans` is not a list |
| `wrap` | `"word"` \| `"char"` \| `"none"` | `"word"` | `word` breaks between words (a word longer than the line breaks by character); `char` breaks anywhere; `none` keeps each `\n`-separated line on one line. Unknown values read as `word` |
| `truncate` | `"end"` \| `"start"` \| `"middle"` | `"end"` | Where an overflowing text is cut: `end` keeps the start (`abcd…`), `start` keeps the end (`…wxyz`), `middle` keeps both ends (`ab…yz`). Unknown values read as `end`. A `truncate` without `wrap` or `lines` keeps the text on one line |
| `lines` | integer | none | Clamp to this many visual lines, the last one ending in `…`. `0` is no clamp. `1` keeps one line |
| `measure` | `"prose"` | none | `prose` caps the line length at 80 cells for readable paragraphs; otherwise the text fills its width |

When fitting runs:

- One line (`wrap = "none"`, `lines = 1`, or a bare `truncate`): Tern cuts only when the text really overflows
  and cuts by `truncate`.
- `lines = N` with wrapping: Tern counts cells per line (the face is monospace) as `wrap` would break them, keeps
  what fits in N lines, drops trailing space and ends with `…` (inside the last line: a full last line gives up
  its final character for it). `truncate` does not apply here: the clamp always
  cuts at the end.
- `truncate = "middle"` with a span styled `path` first drops whole leading directories of that span
  (`Edited …/src/routes/users.ts`), then cuts the middle of the whole text if that was not enough.
- A cut that falls inside a span keeps that span's style, ellipsis included.

```lua
local s = "Indexing the workspace for symbols and references"
ui.node("text", { truncate = "end", spans = { ui.span("end    ", "dim"), s } })
ui.node("text", { truncate = "start", spans = { ui.span("start  ", "dim"), s } })
ui.node("text", { truncate = "middle", spans = { ui.span("middle ", "dim"), s } })
ui.node("text", { truncate = "middle", spans = {
	ui.span("path   ", "dim"), ui.span("Edited ", "muted"),
	ui.span("app/server/src/routes/users.ts", "path"), ui.span(" +12", "ins num"),
} })
ui.node("text", { lines = 2, spans = { ui.span("lines=2 ", "dim"),
	s .. ", then warming the type cache for every open file." } })
```

### Spans

A span is a table; a plain string in a span list is an unstyled span.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `t` | string | The text. An empty `t` draws nothing |
| `s` | string | Space-separated style tokens (below). Absent or `""` is plain. Unknown tokens draw no class (but see program tokens) |
| `href` | string | Makes the span a link (below) |
| `fx` | `"shimmer"` \| `"pulse"` \| `"none"` | An effect. `shimmer` sweeps a highlight across the characters; `pulse` fades the span in and out. Anything else is none |

`tern.ui.span(t, s)` and `tern.ui.link(t, href, s)` build `t`, `s` and `href`; set `fx` on the returned table
yourself. Spans are used by `text` and by every kind that takes span props (`card` and `section` heads, `kv`,
`table` cells, `badge`…), so everything here applies there too.

### Span style tokens

Each semantic token draws as class `.sf-t-<token>` on the span:

| Token | Draws |
| --- | --- |
| `muted` | Quiet text: `--sf-c-muted` |
| `dim` | Quieter text: `--sf-c-dim` |
| `strong` | Weight 600 in the primary text color (`--t1`) |
| `em` | Italic |
| `accent` | `--sf-c-accent` |
| `success` | `--sf-c-success` |
| `warning` | `--sf-c-warning` |
| `error` | `--sf-c-error` |
| `info` | `--sf-c-info` |
| `code` | An inline code chip: `--sf-c-code` on `--chip-bg`, a hairline ring, rounded |
| `mono` | Tabular figures (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) |
| `path` | A file path: `--sf-c-path`. A span with a `/` splits into `span.dir` (the directory, through the last `/`, in `--sf-c-muted`) and the file name. `truncate = "middle"` shortens it by directories |
| `key` | A keycap: padded, on `--l1`, in `--sf-c-key`. A key id with no spaces (`ctrl+r`, `shift+enter`, `f5`) draws as its platform keycap (`⌃R`) with the id as the tooltip |
| `link` | Link color (`--sf-c-link`) without making it a link; use `href` for a real link |
| `num` | A number: tabular figures in `--sf-c-num` |
| `ins` | Inserted text: `--sf-c-ins` |
| `del` | Deleted text: `--sf-c-del`, struck through |
| `mark` | A highlight (a search match, a selected row): a tinted background, `--sf-mark-bg` when set |
| `typo` | A misspelled word: a dotted underline in `--spelling-error-color`, as Tern's text fields mark one |
| `icon` | A Nerd Font glyph at icon metrics (1.2em wide, the Nerd-patched mono face, `aria-hidden`). When the next non-empty span does not start with whitespace, it also gets `.gap` (a small right margin) |
| `hide` | Not drawn (`display: none`), still in the text |

You can combine tokens: `"strong error"`, `"muted path"`. A token appears once even if two tokens map to it.
A `key` span whose text has spaces or is not a `+`-joined id (`Esc to cancel`) draws its text as is.

<figcaption>Each word is a span styled by the token it names: <code>{t = "ctrl+r", s = "key"}</code>, <code>{t = "src/routes/users.ts", s = "path"}</code>, a folder glyph with <code>s = "icon"</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Icons in any text.** A Private Use Area codepoint (U+E000–U+F8FF, planes 15 and 16: Nerd Font icons) in a span
without `icon` is split out into its own span with the span's style plus `icon`. The same happens in `md` prose
and editors, so a Nerd glyph never overlaps the text after it.

### Program (theme) tokens

The omp theme token names also work as span tokens. Each maps to a semantic token so Tern's theme colors it,
and the span also gets an inline `color: var(--sf-p-<token>, <fallback>)`, where the fallback is the mapped
token's `--sf-c-<token>` when it names a color and `inherit` otherwise (`toolTitle` keeps the `strong` weight
and inherits its color). When the user turns on "Use program colors" and the program sent a palette, the
palette's color wins. A plugin sends no palette, so in a plugin view these tokens read as their mapped
semantic token. omp's `accent`, `dim`, `muted`, `error`, `success` and `warning` are semantic tokens already
and get no inline color.

| Tokens | Map to |
| --- | --- |
| `text`, `customMessageText`, `syntaxVariable`, `toolOutput`, `userMessageText` | plain (no class) |
| `borderAccent`, `customMessageLabel`, `mdListBullet`, `statusLineModel`, `syntaxFunction`, `thinkingMedium` | `accent` |
| `borderMuted`, `statusLineSep`, `thinkingOff` | `dim` |
| `border`, `mdCodeBlockBorder`, `mdHr`, `mdLinkUrl`, `mdQuote`, `mdQuoteBorder`, `statusLineOutput`, `statusLineSpend`, `statusLineUntracked`, `syntaxComment`, `syntaxOperator`, `syntaxPunctuation`, `thinkingText`, `thinkingMinimal`, `toolDiffContext` | `muted` |
| `thinkingXhigh`, `thinkingMax`, `toolDiffRemoved` | `error` |
| `statusLineCost`, `statusLineGitClean`, `statusLineStaged`, `syntaxString` | `success` |
| `bashMode`, `statusLineDirty`, `statusLineGitDirty`, `thinkingHigh` | `warning` |
| `pythonMode`, `statusLineContext`, `statusLineSubagents`, `syntaxKeyword`, `syntaxType`, `thinkingLow` | `info` |
| `mdCode` | `code` |
| `mdCodeBlock` | `mono` |
| `mdHeading`, `toolTitle` | `strong` |
| `mdLink` | `link` |
| `statusLinePath` | `path` |
| `syntaxNumber` | `num` |
| `toolDiffAdded` | `ins` |
| `customMessageBg`, `selectedBg`, `statusLineBg`, `toolErrorBg`, `toolPendingBg`, `toolSuccessBg`, `userMessageBg` | nothing: fills never color text |

The inline color goes to the first token of `s` that is not a semantic token, does not end in `Bg`, and is made
of letters, digits, `_` and `-`. That includes tokens Tern does not know: `s = "myTone"` gets
`color: var(--sf-p-myTone, inherit)` and no class. So you can color a span from your own sheet by setting
`--sf-p-myTone` on an ancestor. There are no raw colors in spans.

### Links

A span with `href` draws as `span.sf-link[data-href]` (link color, pointer cursor, underline on hover) with the
tooltip `<href>  ⌘-click to open`. ⌘-click opens it. With Tern's "Open links with" setting on plain click, a
plain click opens it too, unless ⇧ is held or the click ended a text selection.

| `href` | Opens |
| --- | --- |
| A URL with a scheme (`https://…`, `mailto:…`) | Through the window's link handling, `tern.route.link` first (see [Routing](../guides/routing.md)) |
| `file://…` | The file, in a file block, through Tern's system integration |
| No scheme: a path (`./README.md`, `docs/a.md:12`, `../b.md#L3`, `~/x`, `C:\x`) | `%XX`-decoded; a relative one resolves against the pane's working directory; it opens in a file block like a `file://` link. A path that does not exist shows a toast naming the resolved path |

`tern.ui.path(p, cwd)` builds a `path` span linked to the absolute `file://` URL.

### Effects

`fx = "shimmer"` draws each character as `span.sf-sh` with `--i` set to its index, so a highlight sweeps across
(`--sh-lo`, `--sh-hi`, `--sh-mid` set the three colors, defaulting to `--t3`, `--t1`, `--t2`). `fx = "pulse"`
adds `.sf-fx-pulse` (opacity 1 → 0.45 → 1 over 1.6s). Both carry `.sf-fx-<fx>` and keep the document clock's
phase across redraws. Under reduced motion (`.sf-still`) and while the pane is hidden (`.sf-paused`) they stop;
a still shimmer shows its text in the inherited color.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node. Link clicks are handled by Tern and do not reach
your `event`.

**Styling:**

```html
<div class="sf sf-text nowrap" data-id="…" title="full text when cut">
	plain text
	<span class="sf-t-muted">Edited </span>
	<span class="sf-t-path sf-link" data-href="file:///…" title="file:///…  ⌘-click to open">
		<span class="dir">app/src/routes/</span>users.ts
	</span>
	<span class="sf-t-icon gap" aria-hidden="true"></span>
	<span class="sf-t-key" title="ctrl+r">⌃R</span>
	<span class="sf-fx-shimmer"><span class="sf-sh" style="--i:0">W</span>…</span>
</div>
```

An unstyled span with no `href` and no effect is a bare text node, not a `span`.

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-text` |
| One line (`wrap = "none"` or `lines = 1`) | `.sf-text.nowrap` |
| Character wrapping | `.sf-text.char` |
| Prose measure | `.sf-text.prose` |
| A styled span | `.sf-t-<token>` |
| A link span | `.sf-link`, `[data-href]`, `[data-href^="http"]` |
| A path's directory | `.sf-t-path .dir` (inner, may change) |
| An icon followed by text | `.sf-t-icon.gap` |
| Effects | `.sf-fx-shimmer`, `.sf-fx-pulse`, `.sf-sh` (one per shimmering character, inner) |

Variables: `--sf-c-<token>` for each colored token (`muted`, `dim`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `error`,
`info`, `code`, `path`, `key`, `link`, `num`, `ins`, `del`), `--sf-mark-bg`, `--spelling-error-color`,
`--sh-lo`/`--sh-mid`/`--sh-hi`, `--sf-p-<token>`. See [CSS variables](../styles/variables.md).

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

local function header(run)
	local file = ui.path(run.file, run.cwd)
	local line = ui.text({
		ui.span("Edited ", "muted"),
		file,
		ui.span(" +" .. run.added, "ins num"),
		ui.span(" −" .. run.removed, "del num"),
	})
	local p = line.p or {}
	p.truncate = "middle" -- one line; drops directories of the path first
	line.p = p
	return line
end

local busy = ui.span("Indexing…", "muted")
busy.fx = "shimmer"
return ui.col({ header(state.run), ui.text({ busy }) })
```

## `md`

Draws Markdown in omp's dialect through kit's Markdown view, set in the terminal's mono face. The source is
split into top-level blocks, each drawn as its own `div.md`; an update re-parses only the blocks whose source
changed (all of them when the link reference definitions changed). Long documents virtualize: only the blocks
near the viewport are mounted, with spacers standing in for the rest, and code lines, list items and table
rows inside a big block mount the same way. Find and copy still see the whole source.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.md(text)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#text-and-code)), or
`tern.ui.node("md", { text = src, stream = true })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | `""` | The Markdown source |
| `stream` | bool | `false` | The source is still arriving: the last block is provisional (`.streaming`), it may be an unclosed fence or list. Its last element draws at 86% opacity, and a trailing paragraph, heading or list item ends in a pulsing accent caret. A mermaid fence left open shows as code until it closes or `stream` turns off, so a half-written diagram is never laid out |
| `marks` | `Spans` | none | Spans drawn in place of their literal text wherever it occurs in prose. At each point the earliest match wins, the longest on a tie. omp uses it for chips, skills and mentions in a sent prompt |

### Dialect

| Feature | Syntax | Draws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CommonMark | headings, paragraphs, emphasis, links, images, lists, quotes, rules, code | The usual elements. Raw HTML stays literal text (blocks as `div.md-html`) |
| Headings 5 and 6 | `#####`, `######` | `h4.h5`, `h4.h6` (there is no `h5`/`h6`) |
| Hard breaks | two spaces or `\` at line end | `span.br` |
| GFM tables | pipes, `:---:` alignment | `div.tbl > table > thead + tbody`; alignment as inline `text-align` |
| Severity pills | a table cell that is exactly `high`, `medium` or `low` (any case) | `span.sev.<level> > i + text` |
| Task lists | `- [ ]`, `- [x]` | `ul.tasks > li.task` (`.done` when checked, its text struck through), read-only boxes `span.cb[role=checkbox]` (`.on` when checked) |
| Strikethrough, autolinks | `~~x~~`, bare URLs and emails | `del`, links |
| Callouts | a quote whose first line is `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]` or `[!CAUTION]` (any case) | `div.callout.<kind> > .co-ic + div.co-body`; warning and caution tint with `--warn` and a warning icon, the rest with `--accent` and an info icon |
| Math | `$…$`, `\(…\)` inline; `$$…$$`, `\[…\]`, a `\begin{env}…\end{env}` block display | `span.math` (`.display`) or `div.math-display` around a typeset `svg` in `currentColor`; a formula that fails shows `code.math-err` titled with the error. The wrapper holds the TeX in `data-tex`, and a text selection copies it as `$tex$` / `$$tex$$` |
| Code fences | ```` ```lang ```` | `div.code > div.code-head (language + Copy) + pre > code` on `--code-bg`, one span per line, highlighted with `.tk-*` classes (see [`code`](#code)). The head shows only on hover or focus, at the block's top right. The label is the lowercased fence language, `text` without one |
| Mermaid | ```` ```mermaid ```` | `figure.mfig[data-m] > div.mfig-head (icon, "mermaid · <kind>", Open) + div.mfig-body` with the diagram at natural size; wide diagrams scroll sideways |
| Color swatches | a hex color in a code span | a `span.chip` color chip before it |
| Nerd icons | Private Use Area codepoints | `icon` spans (see [Span style tokens](#span-style-tokens)) |

Prose (the text inside paragraphs, headings, list items, cells) is drawn through the same span path as `text`.

**User settings.** "Markdown headings" (Annotated by default) is Tern's, not a prop. Annotated: every heading is
body size, weight 600, in the `mdHeading` color, after a quiet `#`…`######` marker (`::before`, `--t4`).
Annotated adds `.sf-h-annotated` to the regions. Sized: `h1`–`h3` are 20/17/15px sans titles. "Open links with"
decides whether a plain click opens a link, as for spans.

**Copy.** A code block's Copy button (`.code-copy`, in the head shown on hover or focus) puts the
code on the clipboard. A mermaid figure's Open button (`.mfig-open`) shows the diagram large. A text selection
copies as Markdown-backed text, with math as its TeX.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node. Copy, Open and link clicks are Tern's.

**Styling:**

```html
<div class="sf sf-md" data-id="…">

`.sf-md`). Variables: `--code-bg`, `--chip-bg`, `--t1`…`--t4`, `--accent`, `--warn`, `--sf-p-mdHeading`, the
`--tk-*` colors.

Draws a code block with Tern's highlighter, optional line numbers and marked lines. Highlighting runs in the
background over the whole text, so multi-line strings and comments color right; lines show plain until their
colors land. Unwrapped lines scroll sideways inside the block. Past 400 lines (or whenever the block knows its
visible part), the block virtualizes: only the rows near the viewport are mounted, between two spacers. Without
`wrap` the rows are one line tall and the window is the lines in view plus 40 on each side; with `wrap` the rows
keep their wrapped heights.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.code(text, lang, start)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#text-and-code)); with
`start` it also sets `numbers = true`. Or `tern.ui.node("code", { text = src, path = "src/main.rs", wrap = true })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | `""` | The code |
| `lang` | string | none | The grammar by language name or extension (`"rust"`, `"lua"`, `"ts"`). Wins over `path`. Without `lang` and `path` the code is plain |
| `path` | string | none | A file path: picks the grammar by file name when `lang` is absent, and shows a header with a file icon, the dim directory and the file name (tooltip: the path). Without `path` there is no header |
| `numbers` | bool | `false` | Show the line number gutter |
| `start` | integer | `1` | The first line's number |
| `marks` | list of `{line, tone?, ranges?}` | none | Marked lines. `line` counts in the gutter's numbering (from `start`); lines before `start` are ignored. `tone` is one of the [tones](index.md) (default `accent`; unknown tones read as `accent`); the row gets a tone bar and tint. `ranges` is `{{start, end}, …}` byte ranges in that line (end exclusive) drawn with a stronger tint, e.g. search matches |
| `wrap` | bool | `false` | Soft-wrap long lines instead of scrolling sideways |

Highlight token classes, from kit's highlighter:

| Class | Color variable | Typical tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.tk-comment` | `--tk-comment` | comments |
| `.tk-keyword` | `--tk-keyword` | keywords |
| `.tk-function` | `--tk-function` | function names |
| `.tk-variable` | `--tk-variable` | variables |
| `.tk-string` | `--tk-string` | strings |
| `.tk-number` | `--tk-number` | numbers |
| `.tk-type` | `--tk-type` | types |
| `.tk-operator` | `--tk-operator` | operators |
| `.tk-punct` | `--tk-punct` | punctuation |
| `.tk-inserted` | `--tk-inserted` | inserted lines (diff grammar) |
| `.tk-deleted` | `--tk-deleted` | deleted lines (diff grammar) |

The same classes color `md` fences, `diff` and `editor` code. Override the `--tk-*` variables to recolor
everything at once.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

## `diff`

Draws a diff with word-level emphasis and syntax highlighting on both sides. It draws no header of its own: put
it in a `card` whose head names the file. Inside a `card` it sits flush (no ring or background of its own). A
diff with no changes shows "No changes".

**Build it:** `tern.ui.diff(text, path)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#text-and-code)), or
`tern.ui.node("diff", { hunks = …, path = …, mode = "split" })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | none | A unified diff: `@@ -a,b +c,d @@` hunks. `diff --git`, `---`/`+++` and `index` headers are tolerated and name the file. Text with no hunk header at all reads as one hunk of `+`/`-`/` ` lines |
| `hunks` | list of `{oldStart?, newStart?, lines}` | none | Hunks given directly; wins over `text` when it is a list. `oldStart`/`newStart` default to `1`; `lines` are strings starting with `+`, `-` or a space (any other line, and an empty one, reads as context, whole). Lines starting with `\` (`\ No newline at end of file`) are skipped |
| `path` | string | the file the headers name | Picks the grammar when `lang` is absent. Not drawn |
| `lang` | string | none | The grammar by language name; wins over `path` |
| `mode` | `"unified"` \| `"split"` \| `"auto"` | `"auto"` | `unified`: one column, old and new numbers. `split`: old \| new side by side, each side wrapping inside its half, the missing side of an unpaired line left blank. Absent, `auto` or any other value: the user's setting |

**The Edits setting.** For any `mode` but `unified` and `split`, Tern's "Edits" setting decides: Inline (the default) draws
unified; Split draws side by side when the block is wider than 112 cells and unified otherwise, re-deciding as
the width changes. An explicit `mode` wins over the setting.

Paired lines (the i-th `-` and the i-th `+` of one change) get word-level emphasis (`.sf-em`) on the words that
changed, unless either line is over 1000 bytes or both sides are mostly rewritten. Between hunks a fold row says
`⋯ N unchanged lines` (`⋯` alone when the gap is unknown) and the enclosing function from the next hunk's `@@`
header; the first hunk's header text is not drawn. On added and removed lines indented by 2 or more cells,
faint guides mark each indent unit (4 cells with tabs or a multiple of 4, else 2; a tab counts 4) through the
leading whitespace.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

## `ansi`

Draws raw program output in a mini terminal: SGR colors and styles, OSC 8 hyperlinks, `\r` and `\b`. The output
wraps at the block's width and reflows when it changes; a bare `\n` moves to the next line's start, as a pty
would. The block is as tall as its output, but only the lines in view (plus 24 on each side) are painted. ANSI
colors come from the terminal theme (`--ansiN`); the background is transparent.

Text that only grew (a `text append`, or a view whose `text` gained a suffix) feeds just the new tail; any other
change starts the terminal over.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.ansi(text)` (see [UI Builders](../reference/ui.md#text-and-code)), or
`tern.ui.node("ansi", { text = out, follow = true, preview = { lines = 8 } })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | `""` | The output, with escape sequences |
| `cols` | integer | none | The most columns: wrap at this width when the block is wider |
| `preview` | `{lines = N}` | none | Clamp to N lines under a fade, with an "N more lines" button that expands it in place ("Show less" folds it again). The last N lines when `follow`, else the first N. A new `preview` value resets the expansion |
| `follow` | bool | `false` | Keep the tail in view. With `preview`, the clamp shows the tail. With a `max.h` bound, the block keeps scrolled to the bottom until the user scrolls away from it, and follows again once they scroll back to the bottom |
| `max` | `{h = …}` | none | The common size bound. On `ansi`, a `max.h` (`"10lines"`) makes the block scroll vertically (`.scroll`) instead of clipping |

⌘-click on an OSC 8 link opens it (a plain click too, under the "Open links with" plain-click setting, unless ⇧
is held).

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node. The more button is Tern's local state.

**Styling:**

```html
<div class="sf sf-ansi scroll" data-id="…">
	<div class="sf-term-clip clamped fade-bottom" style="--sf-clip:…">
		<div class="tv-mini">…</div>

| Clip | `.sf-term-clip`, `.sf-term-clip.clamped`, `.fade-top` (following), `.fade-bottom` (inner, may change) |
| The terminal | `.tv-mini` (inner) |
| More/less button | `.sf-ansi-more`, `.sf-ansi-more.open` (expanded), `.sf-ansi-more.sf-hidden` (inner) |

## `rows`

The migration fallback: rows a program already rendered for a terminal, shown at exactly `cols` columns with no
rewrap, every line shown, and a dim `fallback` marker in the corner for debugging. It exists for programs moving
to the protocol; a plugin should prefer `ansi`, which reflows.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("rows", { lines = { … }, cols = 80 })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lines` | list of strings | `{}` | The rows, with escape sequences; non-strings are skipped |
| `cols` | integer | `80` | The exact width in columns |

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<div class="sf sf-rows" data-id="…">
	<span class="sf-rows-mark" title="Fallback rows (3)" aria-label="Fallback rows (3)">fallback</span>
	<div class="sf-term-clip"><div class="tv-mini">…</div></div>
</div>
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-rows` |
| Marker | `.sf-rows-mark` (inner, may change) |
| Clip, terminal | `.sf-term-clip`, `.tv-mini` (inner) |

```lua
return tern.ui.node("rows", { lines = { "\27[1mname\27[0m  size", "a.txt     12" }, cols = 40 })
```

## `math`

Typesets one TeX formula with the same engine as `md` math: inline by default, or as a display block.

**Build it:** `tern.ui.node("math", { text = "e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0", display = true })`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | `""` | The TeX, without delimiters |
| `display` | bool | `false` | Display style, as a block centered in the node's width. Display math drops blank lines (they would end the block); inline math is one line (newlines read as spaces) and sits at the node's start |

A formula that does not typeset shows its source as `code.math-err`, titled with the error.

**Children:** none (ignored).

**Events:** none of its own; `actions` work as on any node.

**Styling:**

```html
<div class="sf sf-math display" data-id="…">
	<div class="md">
		<div class="math-display" data-tex="…"><svg>…</svg></div>
	</div>
</div>
<!-- inline: <div class="md"><p><span class="math" data-tex="…"><svg>…</svg></span></p></div> -->
```

| Target | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| The node | `.sf-math`, `.sf-math.display` |
| The formula | `.sf-math .math`, `.sf-math .math-display` (inner, may change) |
| A failed formula | `.sf-math code.math-err` (inner) |

The svg paints in `currentColor`, which the inner elements set to `--t1` (`.md` and, for display math,
`.math-display`), so a `color` on `.sf-math` itself does not reach it. Recolor the formula with
`.sf-math :is(.math, .math-display) { color: … }`.

```lua
local ui = tern.ui

return ui.col({
	ui.text("The identity:"),
	ui.node("math", { text = "e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0", display = true }),
	ui.node("math", { text = "\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}" }),
