# Surface Protocol

The Tern Surface Protocol (TSP) lets a program in a terminal pane describe its
UI as a tree of semantic components. Tern lays that tree out, draws it and
animates it natively. A program that speaks TSP stops painting cells: no
box-drawing glyphs, no background-filled padding, no wrap or truncation math,
no spinner timers and no redraw on resize. It sends *what* is on screen, such
as "a card, pending, whose body is these ANSI bytes, folded to 10 lines", and
Tern decides *how* it looks.

Plugins don't need this part of the book: Tern speaks TSP for a plugin's blocks
and lenses, and a plugin only returns [views](../guides/views.md). These pages
are for programs that run in a pane and write to its pty: a CLI that prints a
table or asks a question, a full-screen TUI, a coding agent such as omp. TSP
works over ssh and through Tern's session daemon, because it travels in-band
with the program's other output.

## Who owns what

| | Owner | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is shown | The program | A document of nodes from the [element vocabulary](../elements/index.md), changed by frames of ops. |
| Layout | Tern | The program never measures text. It needs the width in cells (`cols` in the hello reply and `resize` events) only for the `rows` fallback and ANSI output width. |
| Animation | Tern | Motion kinds (`spinner`, `shimmer`, `elapsed`, …) are clocked by Tern, which honors Reduce Motion. The program sends no per-frame updates. |
| State and input | The program | Keys reach the program as pty input. Its editors, selection lists and modes stay its own state machines, drawn from the state it sends. Pointer actions come back as events. |
| View-only state | Tern | Hover and scroll position are Tern's alone and never reported. Folding and a click on an `el` checkbox or radio change at once in the window and are reported (`toggle`, `change`), so the program can mirror them. |
| Theme | The program, by default | The program sends its palette; a user setting switches back to Tern's theme. Tern's theme always owns the window around the pane. |
| History | The program | Every node stays addressable by id while its surface is open, in the viewport or deep in scrollback, unless Tern drops it under its retention budget (a `gone` event). There are no "final" rows: a card that scrolled away can still change. A closed surface stays on screen with `keep` but takes no more frames. |

A terminal that doesn't speak TSP never answers the [handshake](handshake.md),
and the program keeps its own ANSI renderer.

## A whole session

A CLI asks one question below its own output, reads the answer from the click
that submits it, and exits, leaving its form in the scrollback (`→` program to
terminal on the pty's output, `←` terminal to program on its input):

```text
→ ESC _ tsp;q;{"q":"hello","v":[1],"app":"create-app"} ESC \  ESC [ c
← ESC _ tsp;r;{"r":"hello","v":1,…,"features":[…,"styles","flow"],…} ESC \
← ESC [ ?62;52;c
→ ESC _ tsp;o;{"id":"pick","mode":"flow"} ESC \
→ ESC _ tsp;s;{"sf":"pick","name":"main","css":"…"} ESC \
→ ESC _ tsp;f;{"sf":"pick","s":1,"ops":[["add","main","pick",null,{"id":"main","k":"col","c":[…form…]}]]} ESC \
← ESC _ tsp;e;{"ev":"ack","sf":"pick","s":1} ESC \
← ESC _ tsp;e;{"ev":"change","sf":"pick","id":"l.r","value":"l","checked":true,"name":"size","values":{"size":"l"}} ESC \
← ESC _ tsp;e;{"ev":"action","sf":"pick","id":"go","act":"submit","values":{"size":"l"}} ESC \
→ ESC _ tsp;x;{"id":"pick","keep":true} ESC \
```

The hello reply comes before the DA1 answer, so the CLI knows to speak TSP.
It opens a [`flow` surface](surfaces.md), which sits at the cursor row among
its output, then installs one sheet and adds the `main` region's root, whose
parent is the surface id. The form is `el` nodes (the sheet's `css` is one
string and the node one line on the wire):

```css
.ask { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 8px; max-width: 460px;
  padding: 10px 12px; border-radius: 8px; background: var(--card);
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--l2) }
.ask p { margin: 0 }
.ask .sizes { display: flex; gap: 14px }
.ask :checked+span { color: var(--accent) }
.ask button { align-self: flex-start; padding: 3px 12px; border-radius: 6px;
  background: var(--accent-fill); color: #fff }
```

```json
{"id":"main","k":"col","c":[
 {"id":"ask","k":"el","p":{"tag":"form","class":"ask"},"c":[
  {"id":"q","k":"el","p":{"tag":"p","text":"Which size?"}},
  {"id":"sizes","k":"el","p":{"tag":"div","class":"sizes"},"c":[
   {"id":"s","k":"el","p":{"tag":"label"},"c":[
    {"id":"s.r","k":"el","p":{"tag":"input","type":"radio","name":"size","value":"s"}},
    {"id":"s.t","k":"el","p":{"tag":"span","text":"Small"}}]},
   {"id":"m","k":"el","p":{"tag":"label"},"c":[
    {"id":"m.r","k":"el","p":{"tag":"input","type":"radio","name":"size","value":"m"}},
    {"id":"m.t","k":"el","p":{"tag":"span","text":"Medium"}}]},
   {"id":"l","k":"el","p":{"tag":"label"},"c":[
    {"id":"l.r","k":"el","p":{"tag":"input","type":"radio","name":"size","value":"l"}},
    {"id":"l.t","k":"el","p":{"tag":"span","text":"Large"}}]}]},
  {"id":"go","k":"el","p":{"tag":"button","text":"Create","actions":{"click":"submit"}}}]}]}
```

Tern acks frame 1 once it is drawn. A click on Large checks its radio at once
and reports `change` from the radio node `l.r`, with `values`, the form's
named controls. A click on Create sends `action` with the button's `click`
name as `act` and the same `values`. The CLI closes with `keep`, which leaves
the form, as last drawn, in the scrollback:
