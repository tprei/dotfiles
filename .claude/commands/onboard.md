description: Pick up things where we left off. 
---

- Take a look at the CHANGELOG file as well as git log to see what's missing.
- Take a look at Serena plans or your own .md plans within docs
- Keep in mind there may have been changes by myself or other coding agents

Present back to the user a TODO list containing your understanding of:

 - What was recently done
 - What's up next

 And then confirm whether we will follow up with your "What's up next" goals.
