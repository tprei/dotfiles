- Use context7 for context
- Always write .MD plan/todo files to separate folder. If docs already exists, write it there, otherwise create one
- After you make significant changes, always engage the git commit specialist agent
- DONT ADD FALLBACKS
- When working on a new issue, create a new worktree and branch so that other agents do not conflict with your work in the same environment
- Never add fallbacks
- Never add "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" to PRs
- Never put "commited by agent" or "committed by claude code" -- same for PRs
- Don't write co-authored by Claude
- Always timestamp doc names. Follow conventions of the repo under docs repo
